7,15ty52,0,"As a dutch agricultural student,

1, The farmer matters, be it culture, intelligence or those factors it does matter. All my classmates went on internships in foreign countries and we have all stumbled across just plain stupid agricultural practices. The sort of practices we hear of very early in the education. The agricultural students in foreign countries seem to have the knowledge, but lack the skills/will to actually perform them in reality. Overall you still don't earn much being a farmer.
and people educated in agriculture are lacking in the world.

2, Even when on the edge of production, more production is possible it's just not as easy. Eastern Europe (ex-soviet union) for example is lacking behind tremendously in yields compared with what they could use, the first few changes (simple crop rotation, little bit mechanization) can improve the yields by 10s of percentages, while when on the top you look at improvements of <5%. We have had some stagnation in the west due to legislation aimed to make agriculture more sustainable (limits on fertilizers) and safer (strict control on chemicals used and allowed). 

3, current agriculture favors plains in temperate climates. Crops like maize seem to be yielding more then wheat and have taken over some area's where it could (originally a tropic crop so it has had some difficulties growing it in northern zones) Rice, to me seems like a bit of a dead end crop. Alternative staple crops are a lot easier and do not need even lands while they can be sown easily (not transplanted like rice) and harvested easily on huge fields without having the fear of destroying the many dikes.
