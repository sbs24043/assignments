1, The farmer matters, be it culture, intelligence or those factors it does matter. All my classmates went on internships in foreign countries and we have all stumbled across just plain stupid agricultural practices. The sort of practices we hear of very early in the education. The agricultural students in foreign countries seem to have the knowledge, but lack the skills/will to actually perform them in reality. Overall you still don't earn much being a farmer.
and people educated in agriculture are lacking in the world.

2, Even when on the edge of production, more production is possible it's just not as easy. Eastern Europe (ex-soviet union) for example is lacking behind tremendously in yields compared with what they could use, the first few changes (simple crop rotation, little bit mechanization) can improve the yields by 10s of percentages, while when on the top you look at improvements of <5%. We have had some stagnation in the west due to legislation aimed to make agriculture more sustainable (limits on fertilizers) and safer (strict control on chemicals used and allowed). 

3, current agriculture favors plains in temperate climates. Crops like maize seem to be yielding more then wheat and have taken over some area's where it could (originally a tropic crop so it has had some difficulties growing it in northern zones) Rice, to me seems like a bit of a dead end crop. Alternative staple crops are a lot easier and do not need even lands while they can be sown easily (not transplanted like rice) and harvested easily on huge fields without having the fear of destroying the many dikes.

110,51f76x,3,"After reading the piece again, I can say that I really don't. 
12% isn't in the headline, it's not even in the first half of the article, the sentence is clearly written and directly references that fact that it's a comparison to attainable yield, a number that farmers have achieved and if yield was the sole measure of sustainability would be our goal. 

I see where you a coming from, but it seems to me like his primary motivation for writing it is to illustrate that simply comparing real yield seems natural, but there are other perspectives that are no less mathematically valid. Forcing us to ask why society thinks it's okay to lose 66% of potential yield 'because it's not economical' is okay but another 12% means ""there's no way we can possibly feed the planet"" might not reflect how you like to think about farming but I don't see why it's wrong to bring up. 

If getting high yields are so important for measuring sustainability won't you love the cover issue of national geographic to read ""US Farmers lag potential food output by 66% for bigger paychecks"" (How we can get farmers to stop squandering their acreage and get on board with modern, sustainable methods.)


You won't see that because everyone understands we're making relative decisions based on economic targets. You have a relative economic target, mine is a little different. So if we're going to compare the output of the two, it's reasonable to map the non-economic potential on the spectrum. Comparing a relative value to a relative value has it's place but usually those relative values are placed in the context of a non-relative maximum.

115,aca4z3,3,"Great analogy.   


You're robot example is referred to in computer science as an explore/exploit and a optimal stopping problem.  Explore exploit is trading off between using energy to explore more versus exploiting the previous exploration. The best way to think about these problems is to explore more at the start of a new area (moved to a new place try a bunch of new restaurants) and exploit your knowledge more towards the end of an area (if you're moving away no point in hitting up a new restaurant which even if it's good you'll never go back and risk the chance of it being bad, when you can go to a favorite place you know will be good). Optimal stopping is a similar problem but usually there are constraints on how much you can go back (so if you date 10 girls you marry the next one you meet who is as good as your second or third best of the 10 previous, time is a factor and you've established what's out there and what you like, this is the optimal pattern for statistical wins, not a guarantee). So with the bot chosing squares you would want to teach it to explore enough to get a decent sample of how tall hills are around it, then stop at the next one decently above average. Still likely won't be the highest hill, but gives it the optimal chance.

The other thing is that genetic engineering can pinpoint the genes we can target when breeding.

For example, I used CRISPR to knock out a gene function and I got usable mutants in the second generation (for beginning to end was ~ year for a grass species), but if I had used another method I could have gotten lots of random mutations in the genome which I would then need to breed out, and that would take longer. 

For countries where transgenic or genetically modified plants are not legal commercially, selective breeding is still neccesity but can be sped up through screening plants for certain known genes, without carry over of other genes you don't want.

**Fossil Fuels**

Lets get ONE thing straight: Commercial scale grid power generation is NOT the problem here. And that probably runs counter to everything you have been told, and everything the media shares. In reality, we can retrofit old generators and filter something like 90% of the emissions out. We can take a new build and get pretty damn near 100% out. Toss in some minor additional efforts and very quickly we have a net negative output from the combined project.

We don't need perfect: We need better then perfect - and for power generation at a commercial level? It's fine.

Where it's not fine? Unfiltered gas / oil heating - for homes, greenhouses, and more. It's not fine when we aren't using the filtering technology we have available.

Eventually we will want to move onto something other then fossil fuels - but, the thing is: If we can synthetically make a petrol alternative that is a drop in replacement that as a whole, through partial filtering etc nets us a net-negative on carbon emissions using the technology: there isn't a problem in using fossil fuels.

What we do need to do, is move away from fossil fuels as a primary means for fueling our transportation.

**Agriculture**

Rice is bad, sort of. Meat is worse - from a water stand point, from a land use stand point, and from a emissions stand point: it's bad. It's wasteful. And I AM NOT giving it up. Oh and impossible meat substitute? Ain't that much better - but at least it's vegetarian.

Lab grown meat is actually interesting. It reduces the land use problem, it reduces the water use problem and overall provides a solution to the meat consuming lovers while reducing the strain on the environment and other related issues. But in the same vein - Synthetically generated protiens and, by extension, as we solve that problem, synthetically synthesized vitamins is a very real interesting potential for providing sustenance to a lot of people while reducing overall land need: And we can build the factories that produce these things pretty well anywhere that has access to some amount of water + CO2 source (say next to a fossil fuel burning plant or an incinerator).

On top of this, hydroponics and home growing of suplemental vegitables and herbs is a very good option. Not only does it provide some food that will pay for itself over the long run, but it also provides better air quality within the home. Where space is available to, it would be a worthwhile investment.

**Transportation**

Cars, Planes, boats. We aren't giving them up - but we can do better, a lot better. Planes and Boats are probably the one place I see hydrogen fuel as being a viable alternative: It's energy dense, and the tanks can be separated sufficiently from the passengers to be safe while shielded sufficiently.

But even if we can't get to carbon-less fuel, if we can synthesize the fuel in a way that results in being carbon neutral: that is a big win.

**Energy Generation**

Reality check: We aren't giving up fossil fuels - and largely, we don't need to. Not fully at least - we do need to reduce our dependency on them, and should be aiming to phase them out for the most part completely.

But depending on grid-scale transitions isn't enough, especially as energy demands grow over time. This is where small scale solar and wind installations kick in. For something like 50k investment you could take your house off the central power grid and be just fine. But you could spend as little as 5-10k and supplement your home use.

Nuclear is a very strong option. And in all the discussions - throium reactors really get ignored, something India was (is?) working on.

- Demand, put simply, the US doesn't domestically need to produce as much wheat so the areas capable of handling and manufacturing are often pockets in some key states resulting in again some of the best lands being turned over to other crops due to logistics.

- Single Farm Payment or EU granting, the Eurpean Union will guarantee prices for wheat in some markets and pay Dutch farmers to produce wheat, meaning they can really push on inputs of herbicides, fungicides and fertiliser safe in the knowledge they will have a market for the crop, the US on a fair trade and competition would limit the inputs often used to meet a price point, sometimes farming more acres for the same yield simply makes more sense.

Because it centralizes control of our food supply. The best example of food system centralization of which I'm aware comes from communist countries. It prevents or reduces the ability of farmers to save seeds or cross well-established cultivars.

But let's be honest and discuss the ways giant agri-businesses like Monsanto buy trade journals and influence reports via money donations and commercial sales.

Monsanto even bought out a science firm that showed that their product Round-Up was leading to the collapse of bee colonies. They silenced them by buying them. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-schiffman/the-fox-monsanto-buys-the_b_1470878.html

So don't pretend for one instant that the ""agri-business view"" is the objective view.

It's not.

What you're not doing is thinking about the issue in the long term. Initial chemical yields are slightly higher than organic yields. But that tapers off after the chemicals start to damage the soil.

So what's happening is, in essence, a scam. Like in the old days when disreputable used car salesmen used to put wood chips into damaged cars, which would see them run smooth-as-silk for a week. Then (after the sucker bought the lemon) the car would fall apart.

Likewise chemical yields. ""Look! The first several cycles are producing outstanding crop sizes! Buy this miracle product."" Then five cycles later, the soil starts to get polluted and crop sizes diminish.

**To add some context on how people reach that calculation:**

An American's energy usage is pretty high worldwide, at [10,000 watts](http://insideenergy.org/2017/01/12/energy-explained/) per day. Food is negligible at 130 watts (the average American apparently eats frickin [2700 calories](http://www.farmlandlp.com/2012/01/one-acre-feeds-a-person/), I don't know why). That means a trillion Americans is 10^16 watts. Solar energy hitting the Earth is 10^17 watts, and solar panels are currently about 20% efficient. So we need to cover 50% of the Earth in solar panels (and still have room for our greenhouses and megacities).

So 50% of the Earth is going to be solar (man, this would be easier if we had [self-deploying space mirrors](http://jxcrystals.com/publications/Self_Deploying_Mirrors_Solar_Power_from_Space_10-7.pdf)).

**How densely can we pack our food?**
Today, the order of magnitude given is 250 fed people per km^2. That only gets us to 100 billion even if we used the whole surface area of the Earth. But that's also in the context of Americans raising hamburgers on farmland.

If we switch to greenhouses, we can [pretty reasonably](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9582/how-many-people-can-you-feed-per-square-kilometer-of-farmland) get to around 10-20,000 people per km^2. That means we can feed our trillion people using 50 million km^2, which is just 10% of the Earth's surface.

**Now for housing.** I went with the population density of Manhattan, since I'm using Americans-- there are significantly denser cities. Manhattan has 25,000 people/km^2. That means a trillion people is 40 million km^2, or just under 8% of the Earth.


So altogether my trillion meat-eating Americans (well, it's either lab meat or it's hydroponically grown soybeans) are taking up **68% of the Earth**.

366,pa1cc0,0,"Assuming you're in the USA, there should be a county extension agent there somewhere. These folks work through land grant universities ag departments.

That person can advise you on cash rent rates,county average yields, and probably point you toward some successful farmers in the area.

There are three main ways farms are rented. You can look these up online and read more.

Cash rent:  the farmer pays a fixed amount per acre to use the land.  Zero risk to the land owner from crop loss or market conditions.  Landlord should ask for yield and fertilizer records to make sure the farmer isn't mining the soil. Around here (central Missouri) the dirt will produce 200 to 240 bu corn on average and 50 to 65 bushel beans.  Cash rent ranges from $160 to $200 per acre depending on many factors. Landlord is responsible for property tax and lime to balance soil ph. You also want a farm liability insurance policy.  Tax wise you will use Schedule C just like other rental property.  Your expenses (tax, lime, insurance, cost to visit, etc) are deductible.

Crop Share: You own a percentage of the crop at harvest.  There are numerous versions of this method.  They range from the landlord paying for nothing and getting 20% to 30% of the crop delivered to a local grain merchandiser at harvest to a 50-50 arrangement where the landlord pays for half the cost to raise the crop and the farmer puts in half.  Taxes and insurance are still on the landlord.  Landlord is now assuming part of the risk of bad crops or crappy market conditions.  This is typically more profitable for the landlord and gets you on Schedule F for taxes.  You'll want to buy crop insurance covering your share if you go this way.

Custom Farming: here you manage everything or hire a local farm manager for a cut.  Farm owner buys all inputs and pays the farmer or co-op by the acre to do each operation, spray, plant, harvest, and hauling to the elevator.  Requires knowledge of how to farm, or hiring someone who does.  Most profitable method for the landowner.  Popular with retired farmers who still like to gamble.  Schedule F again.

Those are the highlights.  Your first trip after you inherited this should be with the FSA (USDA Farm Services Administration) office in the county your farm is in.  Your farm has a farm number that is the key to it's history with the USDA.

They need to get all info on your farm updated and (at least in my county) they are very helpful and informative.  They will tell you much about your farm, what programs it is enrolled in, what your historic yeilds are, and what assistance it may qualify for.  You want to be nice to these folks as they can be a good asset and resource.  They can also point you to the extension agent.

They will want to see a copy of the deed showing you as the owner.  You can call and make an appointment which can be over the phone, and paperwork can be shuffled via email and electronic signatures, but I suggest a visit in person.  Farm folks want to get to know you.

If you have family or friends in the area, they can also point out some farmers to talk to.  I'd also advise you to find the names of the farmers whose land surrounds yours.  

Contact them and introduce yourself.  If they are farmers just ask if they're interested in renting and what arrangements they prefer or have with other landlords. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  The good ones will enjoy teaching you how it works.

Also, after you talk to several, you'll get a feel for who's good to work with and who seems full of shit.  There's plenty of both to go around.  

To me, the key is the relationship between farmer and landlord has to be a win-win.  Therefore you need a farmer you trust and you yourself can't be a demanding asshole.  You both have to make a reasonable profit or the relationship won't last.  That's the same for all businesses, not just farming.

Avoid turning the rent or lease of your farm into a bidding war.  Thats pretty common now and it's a great way to wind up with a farmer who mines your soil for a few years and them drops you and leaves you with a ""fixer upper"" farm.  Bidding wars just piss off most of the good farmers who would have taken care of you for the long run.

*RNA demethylation increases the yield and biomass of rice and potato plants in field trials*

>**Abstract**

>RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications are essential in plants. Here, we show that transgenic expression of the human RNA demethylase FTO in rice caused a more than threefold increase in grain yield under greenhouse conditions. In field trials, transgenic expression of FTO in rice and potato caused ~50% increases in yield and biomass. We demonstrate that the presence of FTO stimulates root meristem cell proliferation and tiller bud formation and promotes photosynthetic efficiency and drought tolerance but has no effect on mature cell size, shoot meristem cell proliferation, root diameter, plant height or ploidy. FTO mediates substantial m6A demethylation (around 7% of demethylation in poly(A) RNA and around 35% decrease of m6A in non-ribosomal nuclear RNA) in plant RNA, inducing chromatin openness and transcriptional activation. Therefore, modulation of plant RNA m6A methylation is a promising strategy to dramatically improve plant growth and crop yield.",0.0,0.0,0,24.0,science,Paper httpswwwnaturecomarticlessRNA demethylation increase yield biomass rice potato plant field trialsAbstractRNA Nmethyladenosine modification essential plant Here show transgenic expression human demethylase rice caused threefold increase grain yield greenhouse condition field trial transgenic expression rice potato caused increase yield biomass demonstrate presence stimulates root meristem cell proliferation tiller formation promotes photosynthetic efficiency drought tolerance effect mature cell size shoot meristem cell proliferation root diameter plant height ploidy mediates substantial demethylation around demethylation polyA around decrease nonribosomal nuclear plant inducing chromatin openness transcriptional activation Therefore modulation plant methylation promising strategy dramatically improve plant growth crop yield,0.9597,0.9744,positive,positive,"('',)",0.0

No, because GMO isn't an ingredient. It's a technology used to create the genetics of the seed. GMO is used to create the seed, and the seed grows corn, and corn is on the ingredient label.

However, your concern about precedents is an interesting one. Generally, mandatory labels are reserved for things that are considered essential health or nutrition information. This is why ingredients and nutritional content is mandatory; because it's essential for the consumer to know to make decisions about their health and nutrition. GMO is neither a health or nutrition factor, any more than the type of soil it was grown in, or the star sign the seeds were planted under. To allow mandatory labels for GMO, despite there being zero health or nutrition factor, for no reason other than some people are curious, means that this sets a precedent that anything can become a mandatory label just because a group of people are curious. This means there is theoretically no end to the list of things that could become mandatory labels.

This is the reason the FDA have given as to why they've said no to it being mandatory. It's currently a voluntary ""verified non-GMO"" that does exactly what's being asked, and appears on over 27,000 products.

Each of those pollutants make sense, but I'm really glad they included sulfur dioxide.

Venus, with its lead melt surface temperatures and sulfuric acid rain, is so far beyond the envelope of any known life that I'm dubious bioengineering would be part of the first few thousand years of any terraforming project. 

However, if nanotech self replicators are possible, then it should be possible to carpet Mercury with solar panels, refine magnesium and calcium from surface regolith, and loft it Mercury escape with really long equatorial railguns and towards Venus with self-deploying solar sails. Enough magnesium and calcium meteorites, and the CO2 precipitates out of the Venus's atmosphere as a thick layer of carbonates. See [https://www.universetoday.com/113412/how-do-we-terraform-venus/](https://www.universetoday.com/113412/how-do-we-terraform-venus/) After a few thousand years of this, one can redirect Kuiper belt ice bodies to provide some water (Venus lost nearly all its hydrogen after it went into runaway greenhouse). Install the sunshades at Sun-Venus L1, and  once the surface cools enough from all the impacts that water can condense, then we can look into bioengineered bacteria/algae.

Really, though, why would anyone want to live at the bottom of a gravity well if you didn't have to? The surface of Venus is 10.36 km/s from anywhere interesting, whereas there are much lower tech ways of building habitation amongst the asteroids, where one's just a fraction of a km/s from most rocks in the outer solar system.

So while herbicide use has gone up, health risk goes down. It also allowed more no-tillage methods, so it's saving on soil depletion and carbon emissions too.

In the other, although the hazard is extremely severe, the chances of it happening are low so we accept risks of the occasional visit to an active caldera.

The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population
growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed
in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential
and resilience1,2
. Genetic modification is one potential solution,
but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops
such as wheat3
. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal
in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning
crop growth and development4,5
. Here we show that application
of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels
in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed
and constructed based on a ‚Äòsignalling-precursor‚Äô concept for
permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P
in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar
signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue
improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology
offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress
resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and
other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that
suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can
be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other

Corn-Soybean ethanol is a net carbon polluter. Acre for acre it would make *far* more sense to put up solar fields and battery storage if you're trying to create joules for our use.

Saying that to say this: All the funding for the biofuel lobby was by big agriculture. The Corn and Soybean lobby. When it turned out that switchgrass or other non-corn or soybean crops would make more sense all the funding for it dried up. Who would have thought?

Every year solar panels make a better and better use case. Every year biofuel is worse and worse.

>whether there could be concern that human ingestion of these modified plants could actually lead to negative effects in the long run.

This is a common fear. There are many sources of information and many opinions, some more fact-based than others, on this. The NAS put out a research report (their reports are a gold standard for science policy) on GMO crop safety and efficacy a few years ago, which concluded overwhelmingly that GMO crops currently available for consumption are safe. The report was led by someone who historically was skeptical of the utility of GMO crops: http://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/category/report/.

>Now in full disclosure, I‚Äôm a medical doctor (MD) and the fact that these toxins have known toxicity to insect digestive tracts makes me wonder whether the potential toxic effects of this particular protein have been studied at all in humans.

As above, yes, they have. First of all, it's important to know that Bt was used for insecticides for decades before it was engineered into plants. From the same wiki page you posted: 

>Spores and crystalline insecticidal proteins produced by B. thuringiensis have been used to control insect pests since the 1920s and are often applied as liquid sprays.[34] They are now used as specific insecticides under trade names such as DiPel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators, and most other beneficial insects, and are used in organic farming;[24] however, the manuals for these products do contain many environmental and human health warnings,[35][36] and a 2012 European regulatory peer review of five approved strains found, while data exist to support some claims of low toxicity to humans and the environment, the data are insufficient to justify many of these claims.[37]

So to summarize, Bt and the organisms that produce it are found naturally occurring in the soil, have been (and still is sprayed) on organic crops, have been found in many studies to have no harmful short-term or long-term effects on human health, and are effective at controlling pests if managed responsibly and with an understanding of evolution and agriculture.

Finally, in an era where gut health is an issue and the microbiota of our guts is coming into consideration, what we know from centuries of nutritional science and more recent insights from other fields is that access to affordable, abundant fresh fruits and vegetables is both healthy and environmentally conscious. When people spread poorly thought out and poorly supported fear of GM or non-organic crops, they create yet another barrier to eating a vegetable-heavy diet where many barriers already exist, particularly for people with lower incomes or living in food deserts.

‚ÄúA new scientific review from the University of California, Davis, reports that the performance and health of food-producing animals consuming genetically engineered feed, first introduced 18 years ago, has been comparable to that of animals consuming non-GE feed.

The review study also found that scientific studies have detected no differences in the nutritional makeup of the meat, milk or other food products derived from animals that ate genetically engineered feed.‚Äù

- From the article's abstract: In the coming decades, continued population growth, rising meat and dairy consumption and expanding biofuel use will dramatically increase the pressure on global agriculture.

- It takes 2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline to produce one pound of feedlot beef.
http://www.earthsave.org/environment.htm

- Raising animals for food is grossly inefficient, because while animals eat large quantities of grain, soybeans, oats, and corn, they only produce comparatively small amounts of meat, dairy products, or eggs in return. This is why more than 70 percent of the grain and cereals that we grow in this country [U.S.A.] are fed to farmed animals. It takes up to 13 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of meat, and even fish on fish farms must be fed up to 5 pounds of wild-caught fish to produce 1 pound of farmed fish flesh. http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/meat-wastes-natural-resources.aspx",0.0,0.0,0,3.0,science,This problem worse meat consumption rise answer reduce meat dairy consumption From article abstract coming decade continued population growth rising meat dairy consumption expanding biofuel dramatically increase pressure global agriculture take gallon water pound grain pound topsoil energy equivalent gallon gasoline produce pound feedlot beefhttpwwwearthsaveorgenvironmenthtm Raising animal food grossly inefficient animal large quantity grain soybean corn produce comparatively small amount meat dairy product return This percent grain cereal grow country farmed animal take pound grain produce pound meat even fish fish farm must pound wildcaught fish produce pound farmed fish flesh httpwwwpetaorgissuesanimalsusedforfoodmeatwastesnaturalresourcesaspx,-0.4404,-0.4404,negative,negative,"('',)",0.0
