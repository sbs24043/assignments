1,">Any suggestion on policy towards farmers from him will be met with huge resistance

But that's always the case. Anyone that questions modern farming practice gets a barrage of abuse.

The truth is that we have to reduce emissions across every sector of society. Transport and electricity production are decarbonising fast. Agriculture needs to follow suit. It would be better if they could engage constructively about how that can be achieved, rather than abusing everyone that puts their head above the parapet.",0,,,99,ireland
2,"You have one branch of government trying to keep food prices low,  improving standards and ensuring that farms are profitable in a global market.  This was it what farmers were encouraged to do, when quotas were abolished a few years back it kicked off a increase in the dairy herd and production (beef sector increased as well).  Farmers were advised to increase production (herd numbers).  They took out loans, invested money.  

Now a few years later you have another branch of government saying that they need to reduce numbers and become less profitable.  What’s more the people taking about it are talking down to farmers and some of them blame the agriculture sector for all the emissions.  Do you think that farmers will engage with them?  As I said there was resistance before but it got worse.  It doesn’t that greens don’t understand farming and farming concerns.  

Some were questioning about emissions at the time of the increase in herd numbers but they weren’t listened to by anyone.  Everyone wanted the farming sector to make money as it would boost the rural economy and economy overall, agri foods is a big sector in the economy and it does make money.

In the article Eamon Ryan is suggesting the opposite - he aims to reduce stock numbers but increase income for farmers.

>What’s more the people taking about it are talking down to farmers and some of them blame the agriculture sector for all the emissions.

No-one's saying farmers are responsible for all the emissions, but beef, dairy and lamb farming is responsible for a substantial proportion of national emissions. We've made big reductions in the other major sources of emissions, e.g. replacing peat-fired power stations with renewables, so now it's time for the agricultural sector to play it's part

2,"Sure here's a constructive discussion on the topic:

Methane is yes more ""damaging"" than CO2 but that's not really the whole story.

Methane emissions from cattle is *NOT* compounding. As in it doesn't matter how many cattle there was in the past it only matters how much cattle there is right now.

This is because cattle are part of a carbon cycle, the carbon in the methane didn't just come into existence magically, it came from somewhere, specifically the grass, which got it from the air by photosynthesis.

It's an entirely carbon neutral cycle with only one problem, the methane has to stay in the air for awhile, around 9-12 years (which is actually pretty short). This creates a sort of bank of methane in the air which doesn't increase or decrease in size as long as herd population stays the exact same.

In contrast to your car... which just chucks it into the air and takes 0 out.

Regardless of whether you think viewing the system as being carbon neutral is being fair or not, clearly it's of a lower priority when compared to compounding emission sources (fossil fuels, specifically FUCKING COAL Germany, wtf). 

Farm animals specifically make up [5.8% of emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector). With factors such as synthetic fertilizers (4.1%) also producing large amounts.

So personally I think we should not be reducing herd numbers as it's a relatively small cost for such a massive quality of life improvement (the average persons unwillingness or downright hatred of low meat diets and meat being a much better source of **digestible** nutrients) if anything we should keep herd numbers as high as possible but reduce all other sources of emissions so Europe can rely solely on its locally produced beef which is more environmentally friendly (no burning the rainforest), doesn't contain adjusted hormones or other steroids and is much more ethically produced (I think feedlots should be banned personally, cattle should know what it's like to be on grass).

The Greens view is very short sighted.",0,,,1,ireland

4,"IMO if people aren't eating less meat, the emissions will still be there regardless of where it's produced. And is reducing meat consumption worth it? For 5.8% of emissions which is guaranteed to be removed from the air anyways? I definitely think agriculture can improve overall, like I think the government is doing a good job of giving grants for equipment that is specifically lower emissions (injection slurry tankers vs conventional)

As for our situation with the EU targets specifically I find it extremely odd that Ireland gets blamed for it's beef emissions and not the consumers in other countries. Like if we did that for Oil it wouldn't make sense ""oh it's ok that I run my 5mpg car for thousands of miles, the oil comes from Saudi Arabia so it's their problem"".

Like the Netherlands killing it's agriculture to meet nitrogen emission goals kinda just seems like cheating, they are still going to buy food obviously. Why not keep production local so you use less fossil fuels to transport it?",0,,,3,ireland
5,"Where are you getting 5.8% from? Is that meat production or agri generally?

I think people will have to reduce meat consumption if we don’t meet targets, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t. It’s hard to not be fatalistic about the whole thing",0,,,2,ireland
6,"5.8% is in the article I linked above, it's specifically the animals/manure and doesn't include the other sources of emissions to make feed for the animals etc, but with the right farming methods (and grants for the equipment) you can be very efficient environmentally.

I think this, the population must do it's bit thing is a bit bogus though.

People can't really choose what fuels their car, they are entirely subject to what is available at an affordable price, nor do they decide what creates their electricity or heats their home. They just go with whatever is cheapest because that's what they can afford.

All of Energy accounts for 73% of emissions (that includes transport fyi) and currently around 60% of emissions is absorbed by the oceans and forests (otherwise we would be fucked long ago). This is out of control by the general population, we are squabbling over stupid things when the reality is that it's all the big players, the companys with boards of directors who are the problem.

And our governments solutions are carbon taxes.... Oh great the poor gets poorer and the rich get richer, amazing idea.

The low populated areas has to rely on private transport by simple matter of numbers, it's impossible to match everyone's needs, if you try to impose that, like Spain did, you only force people to move to cities, housing prices increasing, and that's already a huge problem, and more pollution due to population density.",0,,,2,ireland
3,"Ah, cop on there, there are plenty of means of public transport in rural areas such as buses that are already facilitated by the public sector. No reason to not just use them in the public interest instead.

A reasonable solution to even the least dense areas of Ireland is to encourage property owners to live/build within town centres rather than dotted around the place in one-offs and facilitate these hubs with public buses with rail in the larger ones (>1000 people). This would improve house prices in Dublin while raising living standards in rural areas since people could commute via rail to Dublin without having to spend the sort of money required to rent/buy property there. It simultaneously increases the local economies of rural Ireland via increased spending power in the local population.

Also, sprawl is the primary creator of Pollution and environmental damage, not density.

In a way, when you look at cows being fed meal in sheds in other parts of the world and the lovely green grass at how we really should be fighting for a different approach for agriculture. We produce more than we consume food which benefits the world, carbon should be measured at point of consumption instead of point of production just like fuel. Instead of limitations on our farmers, maybe we should tax feed and fertilizer EU wide and have even higher taxes on EU food imports. that would actually give Ireland a huge advantage.

Imagine that 40% of the balloon had say 10 units of bad quality each. Each one is not nearly as bad as the 50unit balloon but together they add up to 4000units of bad quality water.

This is the truth of both climate change and of pollution. The ONLY thing that matters is action that directly affects the main sources of the problem.

Do you know how Ireland could affect the main sources? By localising industry and production of goods using ethical and low carbon methods. By generating energy using nuclear power. 

By properly taxing the carbon cost of any good imported to the country it would create an economic reason for local production of good.

The greater point is that we don't need to have every square cm of the country use for farmland. We produce way more food than we need (85% of beef/dairy is exported) to while not even breaking even.

If we stop providing cheap beef then other won't eat so much of it.

So anyway, chickpeas a shipped. Shipping a tonne uses 3g co2 per km travelled vs 80 for a lorry. In this case the 11,000km trip from india is the same as us transporting beef about 426km. Consider that all our beef exports move mostly on lorries and most of that 85% we produce for export is driven more than that (Athlone to Birmingham has about that much driving).

Wind farms need vast tracks of open land to operate. It's retarded to think that building them in rural areas is an anti-rural conspiracy.

And they are building lots of off shore windfarms on the East coast. That's the only place we can build them because they require shallow waters. Our windiest waters are very deep and not suitable for offshore wind farms.

There will be a new grant coming soon to allow farmers to purchase solar panels, with the state paying for 60%. Whilst solar panels aren't as good here as they are in southern France, they still work. The limiting factor for building wind farms is construction time, and procurement of parts, not a lot of companies make the parts required. However, by focusing on multiple avenues of making the grid clean, it will be done faster. As power generated needs to be used straight away, or stored. Having multiple methods of power production, allows for production to more easily match consumption.

It only has to be packaged in Ireland to be labelled Irish. Ireland and the EU both still import Brazilian beef. Its rare with cows to eat soy I suppose that's more of the pig farming industry.

Realistically, there is no way we meet our climate deadlines while we're farming this way regardless of what other actions we take.

No-one's saying farmers are responsible for all the emissions, but beef, dairy and lamb farming is responsible for a substantial proportion of national emissions. We've made big reductions in the other major sources of emissions, e.g. replacing peat-fired power stations with renewables, so now it's time for the agricultural sector to play it's part

2,"Sure here's a constructive discussion on the topic:

Methane is yes more ""damaging"" than CO2 but that's not really the whole story.

Methane emissions from cattle is *NOT* compounding. As in it doesn't matter how many cattle there was in the past it only matters how much cattle there is right now.

This is because cattle are part of a carbon cycle, the carbon in the methane didn't just come into existence magically, it came from somewhere, specifically the grass, which got it from the air by photosynthesis.

It's an entirely carbon neutral cycle with only one problem, the methane has to stay in the air for awhile, around 9-12 years (which is actually pretty short). This creates a sort of bank of methane in the air which doesn't increase or decrease in size as long as herd population stays the exact same.

In contrast to your car... which just chucks it into the air and takes 0 out.

Regardless of whether you think viewing the system as being carbon neutral is being fair or not, clearly it's of a lower priority when compared to compounding emission sources (fossil fuels, specifically FUCKING COAL Germany, wtf). 

Farm animals specifically make up [5.8% of emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector). With factors such as synthetic fertilizers (4.1%) also producing large amounts.

So personally I think we should not be reducing herd numbers as it's a relatively small cost for such a massive quality of life improvement (the average persons unwillingness or downright hatred of low meat diets and meat being a much better source of **digestible** nutrients) if anything we should keep herd numbers as high as possible but reduce all other sources of emissions so Europe can rely solely on its locally produced beef which is more environmentally friendly (no burning the rainforest), doesn't contain adjusted hormones or other steroids and is much more ethically produced (I think feedlots should be banned personally, cattle should know what it's like to be on grass).

As for our situation with the EU targets specifically I find it extremely odd that Ireland gets blamed for it's beef emissions and not the consumers in other countries. Like if we did that for Oil it wouldn't make sense ""oh it's ok that I run my 5mpg car for thousands of miles, the oil comes from Saudi Arabia so it's their problem"".

6,"5.8% is in the article I linked above, it's specifically the animals/manure and doesn't include the other sources of emissions to make feed for the animals etc, but with the right farming methods (and grants for the equipment) you can be very efficient environmentally.

I think this, the population must do it's bit thing is a bit bogus though.

People can't really choose what fuels their car, they are entirely subject to what is available at an affordable price, nor do they decide what creates their electricity or heats their home. They just go with whatever is cheapest because that's what they can afford.

All of Energy accounts for 73% of emissions (that includes transport fyi) and currently around 60% of emissions is absorbed by the oceans and forests (otherwise we would be fucked long ago). This is out of control by the general population, we are squabbling over stupid things when the reality is that it's all the big players, the companys with boards of directors who are the problem.

I don't know about that to be honest. I lived in very Rural Ireland until just three weeks ago, and the greens occupied nobody's thoughts down here, because the kind of politcs that actually appeals to rural Irish people is the kind where an individual promises your community something if they're elected. 

From that point of view, the farmers are sort of a waste of time for central government to think about; they will complain about anything they don't like, but doing what they want won't turn into votes, because it isn't as tangible as a new community centre that their local is offering them.",0,,,6,ireland

The low populated areas has to rely on private transport by simple matter of numbers, it's impossible to match everyone's needs, if you try to impose that, like Spain did, you only force people to move to cities, housing prices increasing, and that's already a huge problem, and more pollution due to population density.",0,,,3,ireland
3,"Ah, cop on there, there are plenty of means of public transport in rural areas such as buses that are already facilitated by the public sector. No reason to not just use them in the public interest instead.

A reasonable solution to even the least dense areas of Ireland is to encourage property owners to live/build within town centres rather than dotted around the place in one-offs and facilitate these hubs with public buses with rail in the larger ones (>1000 people). This would improve house prices in Dublin while raising living standards in rural areas since people could commute via rail to Dublin without having to spend the sort of money required to rent/buy property there. It simultaneously increases the local economies of rural Ireland via increased spending power in the local population.

Also, sprawl is the primary creator of Pollution and environmental damage, not density. Since density reduces the emissions due to infrastructure and other sources, increasing density versus a massive swamp of human habitation destroys habitats. It massively reduces the ability for public property in land and infrastructure, which increases emissions.",0,,,0,ireland
4,"All of that cost money which is the main reason to not do it and keep relying in private transport while the float get renewed to electric and non fossil fuels.

To be clear, farming is a very difficult job and a fair society should try and reward people for their hard work. I think the farming leaders who are trying new things to reduce carbon output at the cost of their own products is purely inspirational. In a way, when you look at cows being fed meal in sheds in other parts of the world and the lovely green grass at how we really should be fighting for a different approach for agriculture. We produce more than we consume food which benefits the world, carbon should be measured at point of consumption instead of point of production just like fuel. Instead of limitations on our farmers, maybe we should tax feed and fertilizer EU wide and have even higher taxes on EU food imports. that would actually give Ireland a huge advantage.

What ""we"" need is determined at the EU scale not the local scale because again that's the whole point of the EU in the first place. And food security is hugely important to the EU, like there's grants for specifically the types of crops that are grown in large quantities in Ukraine because the EU is afraid their harvest won't arrive.

If we stop providing cheap beef then other won't eat so much of it.

So anyway, chickpeas a shipped. Shipping a tonne uses 3g co2 per km travelled vs 80 for a lorry. In this case the 11,000km trip from india is the same as us transporting beef about 426km. Consider that all our beef exports move mostly on lorries and most of that 85% we produce for export is driven more than that (Athlone to Birmingham has about that much driving).

It only has to be packaged in Ireland to be labelled Irish. Ireland and the EU both still import Brazilian beef. Its rare with cows to eat soy I suppose that's more of the pig farming industry.

No-one's saying farmers are responsible for all the emissions, but beef, dairy and lamb farming is responsible for a substantial proportion of national emissions.

2,"Sure here's a constructive discussion on the topic:

Methane is yes more ""damaging"" than CO2 but that's not really the whole story.

Methane emissions from cattle is *NOT* compounding. As in it doesn't matter how many cattle there was in the past it only matters how much cattle there is right now.

This is because cattle are part of a carbon cycle, the carbon in the methane didn't just come into existence magically, it came from somewhere, specifically the grass, which got it from the air by photosynthesis.

It's an entirely carbon neutral cycle with only one problem, the methane has to stay in the air for awhile, around 9-12 years (which is actually pretty short). This creates a sort of bank of methane in the air which doesn't increase or decrease in size as long as herd population stays the exact same.

In contrast to your car... which just chucks it into the air and takes 0 out.

Regardless of whether you think viewing the system as being carbon neutral is being fair or not, clearly it's of a lower priority when compared to compounding emission sources (fossil fuels, specifically FUCKING COAL Germany, wtf). 

Farm animals specifically make up [5.8% of emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector). With factors such as synthetic fertilizers (4.1%) also producing large amounts.

So personally I think we should not be reducing herd numbers as it's a relatively small cost for such a massive quality of life improvement (the average persons unwillingness or downright hatred of low meat diets and meat being a much better source of **digestible** nutrients) if anything we should keep herd numbers as high as possible but reduce all other sources of emissions so Europe can rely solely on its locally produced beef which is more environmentally friendly (no burning the rainforest), doesn't contain adjusted hormones or other steroids and is much more ethically produced (I think feedlots should be banned personally, cattle should know what it's like to be on grass).

The Greens view is very short sighted.",0,,,2,ireland

4,"IMO if people aren't eating less meat, the emissions will still be there regardless of where it's produced. And is reducing meat consumption worth it? For 5.8% of emissions which is guaranteed to be removed from the air anyways? I definitely think agriculture can improve overall, like I think the government is doing a good job of giving grants for equipment that is specifically lower emissions (injection slurry tankers vs conventional)

As for our situation with the EU targets specifically I find it extremely odd that Ireland gets blamed for it's beef emissions and not the consumers in other countries. Like if we did that for Oil it wouldn't make sense ""oh it's ok that I run my 5mpg car for thousands of miles, the oil comes from Saudi Arabia so it's their problem"".

Like the Netherlands killing it's agriculture to meet nitrogen emission goals kinda just seems like cheating, they are still going to buy food obviously. Why not keep production local so you use less fossil fuels to transport it?",0,,,3,ireland
5,"Where are you getting 5.8% from? Is that meat production or agri generally?

6,"5.8% is in the article I linked above, it's specifically the animals/manure and doesn't include the other sources of emissions to make feed for the animals etc, but with the right farming methods (and grants for the equipment) you can be very efficient environmentally.

I think this, the population must do it's bit thing is a bit bogus though.

People can't really choose what fuels their car, they are entirely subject to what is available at an affordable price, nor do they decide what creates their electricity or heats their home. They just go with whatever is cheapest because that's what they can afford.

All of Energy accounts for 73% of emissions (that includes transport fyi) and currently around 60% of emissions is absorbed by the oceans and forests (otherwise we would be fucked long ago). This is out of control by the general population, we are squabbling over stupid things when the reality is that it's all the big players, the companys with boards of directors who are the problem.

I don't know about that to be honest.

The low populated areas has to rely on private transport by simple matter of numbers, it's impossible to match everyone's needs, if you try to impose that, like Spain did, you only force people to move to cities, housing prices increasing, and that's already a huge problem, and more pollution due to population density.",0,,,3,ireland
3,"Ah, cop on there, there are plenty of means of public transport in rural areas such as buses that are already facilitated by the public sector. No reason to not just use them in the public interest instead.

A reasonable solution to even the least dense areas of Ireland is to encourage property owners to live/build within town centres rather than dotted around the place in one-offs and facilitate these hubs with public buses with rail in the larger ones (>1000 people). This would improve house prices in Dublin while raising living standards in rural areas since people could commute via rail to Dublin without having to spend the sort of money required to rent/buy property there. It simultaneously increases the local economies of rural Ireland via increased spending power in the local population.

Also, sprawl is the primary creator of Pollution and environmental damage, not density. Since density reduces the emissions due to infrastructure and other sources, increasing density versus a massive swamp of human habitation destroys habitats.

In a way, when you look at cows being fed meal in sheds in other parts of the world and the lovely green grass at how we really should be fighting for a different approach for agriculture. We produce more than we consume food which benefits the world, carbon should be measured at point of consumption instead of point of production just like fuel. Instead of limitations on our farmers, maybe we should tax feed and fertilizer EU wide and have even higher taxes on EU food imports. that would actually give Ireland a huge advantage.

Even slurry can be used to provide biogas via methane extraction( which hugely reduces the methane omissions). Ireland and Irish farmers have a opportunity to be world leaders in sustainable farming.
Why aren’t farms made carbon neutral with something as simple as solar on all farm roofs? Instead we congratulate conglomerates for putting solar farms on perfectly good productive land. 
The reality is simple, farming is necessary, Even if we just grow vegetables it will still be farmers and you will still have water pollution issues that need to be addressed.
Ireland simply reducing their herd is a place of privilege from the greens and anyone who supports them.  If the future trend is for higher temps it means that Ireland will have to produce more to make up for the areas that can’t. 
Eamon Ryan’s plan isn’t a plan, we need to produce more and reduce emissions. This is achievable with the current herd and less nitrogen. Just saying reduce the herd isn’t actually a solution, or at least not the only one!

All of this Ireland going green BS is entirely policitally and not at all rooted in reality. 

So long as China, India, Brazil and the USA continue to emit fuck tonnes of emissions, we can do nought and should do nought.

It's like going to a pool and putting water balloons into it. Each balloon is filled with water of varying levels of quality and size. Imagine now that one small balloon, barely .1 of the total overall mass, has 50units worse water quality. 

By your logic, fixing that balloon and getting it out of the pool is important and a major issue. 

But what happens when we burst all of the balloon? That 50units  of bad quality is diluted by the general mass. 

Imagine that 40% of the balloon had say 10 units of bad quality each. Each one is not nearly as bad as the 50unit balloon but together they add up to 4000units of bad quality water.

This is the truth of both climate change and of pollution. The ONLY thing that matters is action that directly affects the main sources of the problem.

Do you know how Ireland could affect the main sources? By localising industry and production of goods using ethical and low carbon methods. By generating energy using nuclear power. 

By properly taxing the carbon cost of any good imported to the country it would create an economic reason for local production of good. 

Then what? Then the countries that use shameful practises would see that they can't make a quick profit by selling Ireland goods that they make cheaply by ignoring world standards on labour, carbon control and pollution.

The more states that fail to live up to th3se targets, the less effective the EU is in reaching its goals.

As a result, our beef industry is also actively contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon.

If we stop providing cheap beef then other won't eat so much of it.

So anyway, chickpeas a shipped. Shipping a tonne uses 3g co2 per km travelled vs 80 for a lorry. In this case the 11,000km trip from india is the same as us transporting beef about 426km. Consider that all our beef exports move mostly on lorries and most of that 85% we produce for export is driven more than that (Athlone to Birmingham has about that much driving).

Having multiple methods of power production, allows for production to more easily match consumption.

It only has to be packaged in Ireland to be labelled Irish. Ireland and the EU both still import Brazilian beef. Its rare with cows to eat soy I suppose that's more of the pig farming industry.

I actually think in 50 years the majority of people in ireland will be vegan or at least vegetarian. What's stopping people is convenience and taste, both of which are rapidly evaporating problems.

Realistically, there is no way we meet our climate deadlines while we're farming this way regardless of what other actions we take. We're destroying our waterways, polluting our ground water (which we're _reeeeally_ going to need as this keeps getting worse), and we've stripped our country of any natural forests.

This is conjecture and since veganism is growing its obviously not the whole truth at the very least.

Also the biggest consumer of plant based meats are non vegans.

Bigger operators will buy it to increase their business or investors will by it for planting, rewilding etc..

We will end up going down a similar road to New Zeland, with a relatively small number of farmers running very big operations. I expect it to end up with investors and business people owning theproductive land and employing farm managers to run & work it..

In the article Eamon Ryan is suggesting the opposite - he aims to reduce stock numbers but increase income for farmers.

>What’s more the people taking about it are talking down to farmers and some of them blame the agriculture sector for all the emissions.

No-one's saying farmers are responsible for all the emissions, but beef, dairy and lamb farming is responsible for a substantial proportion of national emissions. We've made big reductions in the other major sources of emissions, e.g. replacing peat-fired power stations with renewables, so now it's time for the agricultural sector to play it's part

2,"Sure here's a constructive discussion on the topic:

Methane is yes more ""damaging"" than CO2 but that's not really the whole story.

Methane emissions from cattle is *NOT* compounding. As in it doesn't matter how many cattle there was in the past it only matters how much cattle there is right now.

This is because cattle are part of a carbon cycle, the carbon in the methane didn't just come into existence magically, it came from somewhere, specifically the grass, which got it from the air by photosynthesis.

It's an entirely carbon neutral cycle with only one problem, the methane has to stay in the air for awhile, around 9-12 years (which is actually pretty short). This creates a sort of bank of methane in the air which doesn't increase or decrease in size as long as herd population stays the exact same.

In contrast to your car... which just chucks it into the air and takes 0 out.

Regardless of whether you think viewing the system as being carbon neutral is being fair or not, clearly it's of a lower priority when compared to compounding emission sources (fossil fuels, specifically FUCKING COAL Germany, wtf). 

Farm animals specifically make up [5.8% of emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector). With factors such as synthetic fertilizers (4.1%) also producing large amounts.

So personally I think we should not be reducing herd numbers as it's a relatively small cost for such a massive quality of life improvement (the average persons unwillingness or downright hatred of low meat diets and meat being a much better source of **digestible** nutrients) if anything we should keep herd numbers as high as possible but reduce all other sources of emissions so Europe can rely solely on its locally produced beef which is more environmentally friendly (no burning the rainforest), doesn't contain adjusted hormones or other steroids and is much more ethically produced (I think feedlots should be banned personally, cattle should know what it's like to be on grass).

The Greens view is very short sighted.",0,,,0,ireland

4,"IMO if people aren't eating less meat, the emissions will still be there regardless of where it's produced. And is reducing meat consumption worth it? For 5.8% of emissions which is guaranteed to be removed from the air anyways? I definitely think agriculture can improve overall, like I think the government is doing a good job of giving grants for equipment that is specifically lower emissions (injection slurry tankers vs conventional)

As for our situation with the EU targets specifically I find it extremely odd that Ireland gets blamed for it's beef emissions and not the consumers in other countries. Like if we did that for Oil it wouldn't make sense ""oh it's ok that I run my 5mpg car for thousands of miles, the oil comes from Saudi Arabia so it's their problem"".

Like the Netherlands killing it's agriculture to meet nitrogen emission goals kinda just seems like cheating, they are still going to buy food obviously. Why not keep production local so you use less fossil fuels to transport it?",0,,,3,ireland
5,"Where are you getting 5.8% from? Is that meat production or agri generally?

I think people will have to reduce meat consumption if we don’t meet targets, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they don’t. It’s hard to not be fatalistic about the whole thing",0,,,2,ireland
6,"5.8% is in the article I linked above, it's specifically the animals/manure and doesn't include the other sources of emissions to make feed for the animals etc, but with the right farming methods (and grants for the equipment) you can be very efficient environmentally.

I think this, the population must do it's bit thing is a bit bogus though.

People can't really choose what fuels their car, they are entirely subject to what is available at an affordable price, nor do they decide what creates their electricity or heats their home. They just go with whatever is cheapest because that's what they can afford.

All of Energy accounts for 73% of emissions (that includes transport fyi) and currently around 60% of emissions is absorbed by the oceans and forests (otherwise we would be fucked long ago). This is out of control by the general population, we are squabbling over stupid things when the reality is that it's all the big players, the companys with boards of directors who are the problem.

And our governments solutions are carbon taxes.... Oh great the poor gets poorer and the rich get richer, amazing idea.

The low populated areas has to rely on private transport by simple matter of numbers, it's impossible to match everyone's needs, if you try to impose that, like Spain did, you only force people to move to cities, housing prices increasing, and that's already a huge problem, and more pollution due to population density.",0,,,3,ireland
3,"Ah, cop on there, there are plenty of means of public transport in rural areas such as buses that are already facilitated by the public sector. No reason to not just use them in the public interest instead.

A reasonable solution to even the least dense areas of Ireland is to encourage property owners to live/build within town centres rather than dotted around the place in one-offs and facilitate these hubs with public buses with rail in the larger ones (>1000 people). This would improve house prices in Dublin while raising living standards in rural areas since people could commute via rail to Dublin without having to spend the sort of money required to rent/buy property there. It simultaneously increases the local economies of rural Ireland via increased spending power in the local population.

Also, sprawl is the primary creator of Pollution and environmental damage, not density.

In a way, when you look at cows being fed meal in sheds in other parts of the world and the lovely green grass at how we really should be fighting for a different approach for agriculture. We produce more than we consume food which benefits the world, carbon should be measured at point of consumption instead of point of production just like fuel. Instead of limitations on our farmers, maybe we should tax feed and fertilizer EU wide and have even higher taxes on EU food imports. that would actually give Ireland a huge advantage.

What ""we"" need is determined at the EU scale not the local scale because again that's the whole point of the EU in the first place. And food security is hugely important to the EU, like there's grants for specifically the types of crops that are grown in large quantities in Ukraine because the EU is afraid their harvest won't arrive.

Imagine that 40% of the balloon had say 10 units of bad quality each. Each one is not nearly as bad as the 50unit balloon but together they add up to 4000units of bad quality water.

This is the truth of both climate change and of pollution. The ONLY thing that matters is action that directly affects the main sources of the problem.

Do you know how Ireland could affect the main sources? By localising industry and production of goods using ethical and low carbon methods. By generating energy using nuclear power. 

By properly taxing the carbon cost of any good imported to the country it would create an economic reason for local production of good.

As a result, our beef industry is also actively contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon.

Unless we cull the herd down to a level where we don't need to rely on South American animal feed imports, we're not much better than beef produced there. In fact, in some ways we're worse.

The greater point is that we don't need to have every square cm of the country use for farmland. We produce way more food than we need (85% of beef/dairy is exported) to while not even breaking even.

If we stop providing cheap beef then other won't eat so much of it.

So anyway, chickpeas a shipped. Shipping a tonne uses 3g co2 per km travelled vs 80 for a lorry. In this case the 11,000km trip from india is the same as us transporting beef about 426km. Consider that all our beef exports move mostly on lorries and most of that 85% we produce for export is driven more than that (Athlone to Birmingham has about that much driving).

Wind farms need vast tracks of open land to operate. It's retarded to think that building them in rural areas is an anti-rural conspiracy.

The Green party habe massively titled the transport budget in favour of public transport and this has included unprecedented expansion in rural public transport.

And they are building lots of off shore windfarms on the East coast. That's the only place we can build them because they require shallow waters. Our windiest waters are very deep and not suitable for offshore wind farms.

There will be a new grant coming soon to allow farmers to purchase solar panels, with the state paying for 60%. Whilst solar panels aren't as good here as they are in southern France, they still work. The limiting factor for building wind farms is construction time, and procurement of parts, not a lot of companies make the parts required. However, by focusing on multiple avenues of making the grid clean, it will be done faster. As power generated needs to be used straight away, or stored. Having multiple methods of power production, allows for production to more easily match consumption.   
With that said, the government should instead pay 100% of the solar panel costs, because putting solar panels on tops of sheds, is a lot cheaper than buying land. Plus, procuring and installing solar panels takes much less time.",0,,,1,ireland

We need to cut back or go vegan. We already import Brazilian beef and Brazilian soy beans as animal feed. We export 80% of the animal products produced here as it is.

It is incredibly expensive to change from cattle to crops, there are specialised machines that you will need that could be upwards of half a million Euro, plus you need much more powerful tractors, as plowing and cultivating are horsepower intensive, so more fuel usage. These more powerful tractors, could again cost around half a million Euro. For all the farms in the country, the state would be spending billions of Euro. 

I haven’t seen any Brazilian beef in shops or butchers. For most of the year cattle are fed grass, sometimes ration will be imported for during winter months, but often times farmers have a stockpile of silage. 

Who will pay for them to be stewards? Who says they want to be stewards?

The vast majority of people aren’t going to cut back or go vegan. People going vegan is purely an idealists view, you gotta be realistic, there are much more impactful things we can do to fix the situation. Like making the grid completely clean.

Addressed that in my comment

>I haven’t seen any Brazilian beef in shops or butchers.

It only has to be packaged in Ireland to be labelled Irish. Ireland and the EU both still import Brazilian beef. Its rare with cows to eat soy I suppose that's more of the pig farming industry.

>Who will pay for them to be stewards?

Government and taxes, same way they're paid now.

>Who says they want to be stewards?

It's not about what they want at this stage, I know they're poor things for having to get normal jobs like everyone else but we really don't have a choice.

>there are much more impactful things we can do to fix the situation.

Its the single biggest impact you can have as an individual. You really think our government is going to suddenly grow morals and put its foot down? It has to come from consumer side

>Methane from the past will be going away in the present. The level of methane typically stays the same as it goes away over time. The level of carbon dioxide however, has been constantly rising, it is carbon dioxide output that we need to tackle.

I actually think in 50 years the majority of people in ireland will be vegan or at least vegetarian. What's stopping people is convenience and taste, both of which are rapidly evaporating problems. Frankly in 50 years there will be no more excuses to continue to abuse animals and fuck our ecology, especially considering how younger generations are becoming more and more environmentally and ethically conscious. 

>realistic

Realistically, there is no way we meet our climate deadlines while we're farming this way regardless of what other actions we take. We're destroying our waterways, polluting our ground water (which we're _reeeeally_ going to need as this keeps getting worse), and we've stripped our country of any natural forests. To raise animals that we don't need to eat, that leads to all sorts of health problems for us including a host of cancers and heart disease, our number one killer, and exporting 80% at the expense of our countries health.

They don't fund this currently, what I'm saying is if there's the demand, subsidies could fund this switch. Also the state does, that's what subsidies are. Its public knowledge https://www.teagasc.ie/publications/2020/cap-provides-important-funds-for-irish-farms.php
