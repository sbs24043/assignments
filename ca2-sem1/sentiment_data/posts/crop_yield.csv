but my PI suggested i could locate suitable areas for crops. it would likely be a binary index model or i could try multi criteria decision analysis to complete this. i’ve googled, not entirely sure what this means. the data i assume i will gather is elevation, topology, soil type, rainfall etc..)  

does anyone have any tips on how to begin? (please keep in mind i am novice at best in ArcGIS, i know my way around but still need to understand the theory behind many geoprocessing tools).

1cpfyn1,Crop yields down massively just before harvest?,8,1.0,"I'm currently in September and getting ready to harvest my wheat, flax and barley fields. But just as I loaded up my farmhouses with workers, I noticed that the yields had fallen to about 6-12 units for each. These are fields of 2-3 morgen in size. The wheat and flax were sown at the end of the previous season, and the barley was sown in March. The fertility was at least light green for each. I noticed that the wheat and flax yields were each between 100-200 around early summer, while the barley was lower but definitely several times larger than it is now.

I'm not in a drought as all the grass around is lush green and I can't recall being notified of one. Any ideas for what could have caused this? It's been a year of stomping brigands abroad so I've only glanced at the crops once or twice.",

1ay8l6z,Obtaining Crop Yield Data for past years? ,10,0.43,I have inherited a few sections in Oklahoma recently and I am concerned that the longevity of these farms is in significant doubt due to climate change. I want to look at the yields on the farms going back as far as I can. Is there a way to access that information through the ag department or something similar? The family member who knew that info has died (hence inheritance) and so has the guy who farmed it up until two years ago so neither of those avenues are available. Thanks! ,

195wt0c,Bootstrapping method for crop yield prediction,7,1.0,"I have four years worth of yield data on a field:

|2020|2021|2022|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|305 lbs/acre|861 lbs/acre|1005 lbs/acre|1635 lbs/acre|

I want to estimate the field's yield in 2024 using these few data points and prior knowledge. We know that:

\- the average yield of fields in the area is 1600 lbs/acre,

\- the farmer had issues growing the field in 2020 and 2021 and the field was more representable of a normal crop from 2022 onward.

I bootstrapped the dataset three times (1000 resamples each) to develop a better understanding of the distribution of these data. The first bootstrap used the four datapoints from the original dataset. The second used datapoints from 2021, 2022, and 2023, assuming that 2020 was an outlier. The third replaced 2020 and 2021 datapoints with the average yield of crops in the area (1600 lbs/acre).

With each iteration, the standard error and CIs became smaller and in the third iteration the histogram approached a more normal shape.

**I would like to know if this is a statistically sound method to asses and alter data** (using prior knowledge) to better predict future yields. For this to be a repeatable procedure, I am thinking that standard acceptable values would need to be established. E.g. average yield = 1600 lbs/acre, acceptable 95% confidence interval = 750 lbs/acre, normality of distribution, etc.
