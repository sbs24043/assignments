crop AND yield,science,7oy2om,"Science AMA Series: We are researchers from the University of South Africa and we're putting greenhouse gases directly into actual greenhouses; we thereby capture carbon emissions, reduce water consumption and increase crop yield. Ask Us Anything!",21,0.78,"Water scarcity poses a severe threat to all humankind, with rapidly growing demand pressuring already-constrained water resources, many of which are unsustainable. Figuring out where our water ends up is therefore a crucial step toward finding ways to use it more efficiently and try to ensure that we, as a species, are still around a few generations from now. 


Dr Neil Stacey is a young researcher previously known for best known for patented advances in bio-fuels production technology. In late 2016 he set out to use chemical engineering modeling methods to examine water usage in agriculture, which comprises 70% of all of mankind's water consumption. 


Professor Diane Hildebrandt lent her considerable support to the project soon after. She is a director of UNISA's IDEAS institute. She has been the recipient of a number of prestigious scientific awards including the Meiring Naude Medal, the Bill Neale-May Gold Medal, the Distinguished Woman Scientist Award and an AfricanUnion Scientific Award. She has been the author or co-author of over one hundred and fifty peer-reviewed scientific publications including three textbooks and an invited paper in Science. 


By building chemical and thermal models of greenhouses as bio-reactors, we have been able to develop fundamental insights into cause-and-effect relationships in greenhouse design and operation. We found that greenhouse operation is constrained by the necessity of supplying adequate CO2 for photosynthesis. Since CO2 is highly dilute, this constraint demands a very high air-flow through a greenhouse which in turn causes excessive water evaporation and heat losses. Consequently, providing enriched CO2 can drastically reduce the heat and water requirements of a greenhouse. In a paper currently in the final stages of review, we showed that using membrane separation to partially enrich air as a feed can cut water usage considerably. 


We also investigated the possibility of using power station flue gas as a source of enriched CO2. In a recent paper, we quantified the potential costs and benefits of diverting flue gases from gas-fired power stations into greenhouses, finding that this approach can achieve large-scale carbon capture without costly separation, while massively boosting agricultural output and drastically reducing water requirements.


And so, we are here to field your questions as we advocate for putting greenhouse gases into actual greenhouses.

I think it's really important for scientists to talk about their science with non-scientists because what we do matters to everyone and the environment. I am on Sense about Science’s [plant science panel](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/plant-science-expert-panel.html), where you can put questions and opinions for response from researchers.

In order to feed a growing population, estimates suggest that world food production must increase by 70% by 2050. Wheat is a major crop grown worldwide and increasing its yields provides an opportunity to meet this demand. My colleagues and I at the University of Essex have worked closely with researchers at Lancaster University and Rothamsted Research to increase wheat yields by improving the efficiency of photosynthesis, where light energy is converted into biomass. We’ve done this by increasing the expression of an enzyme in the photosynthetic process. We will soon begin field trails at Rothamsted to evaluate the performance of the GM wheat in real world conditions.

I would guess that they obviously take into account cost of growing, price to sell for and rough yield but how do you determine what's best for a particular field? I heard that you can hire someone to professionally evaluate a field, but I wonder how they would do that and what tools are used; are measurements taken of soil nutrients and water content? Is that something farmers often do themselves? Is it really expensive to hire someone to do that? I also heard that sometimes after crops are planted some farmers will send destructive samples to a lab to assess plant health. What are the benefits / drawbacks of this and is this expensive?

crop AND yield,farming,15thexi,Advances in the field of agriculture since 2005,36,0.33,"Since 2005, the field of agriculture has undergone notable advancements, marked by the convergence of technological, scientific, and sustainable practices. This period has witnessed a profound transformation in various domains of agricultural science and practice, driven by advancements in genomics, precision agriculture, agroecology, biotechnology, and digital innovation. These developments have collectively propelled agriculture towards enhanced productivity, resource efficiency, environmental stewardship, and global food security.

Genomic advancements have engendered a paradigm shift in crop breeding and improvement. High-throughput sequencing technologies, coupled with bioinformatics tools, have expedited the identification and manipulation of key genetic traits governing yield, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. The advent of genome editing techniques, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, has facilitated precise and targeted genetic modifications, enabling the creation of novel crop varieties with enhanced traits, while mitigating the controversy associated with transgenic approaches.

Precision agriculture has emerged as a pivotal strategy for optimizing resource allocation and crop management. Integration of remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has enabled real-time monitoring of field conditions, pest outbreaks, and nutrient levels. Data-driven decision support systems have empowered farmers to tailor interventions with unprecedented accuracy, minimizing input wastage, reducing environmental impact, and augmenting yield.

Agroecology has gained traction as a holistic and sustainable approach to farming. Fostering synergistic interactions between ecological processes and agricultural systems, agroecology promotes biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem resilience. Incorporation of cover crops, crop rotation, and intercropping practices has enriched soil organic matter, curtailed erosion, and curbed reliance on chemical inputs. This systems-oriented approach prioritizes resilience and adaptability in the face of climate variability and changing pest dynamics.

Biotechnology has experienced notable progress, characterized by novel biopesticides, biofertilizers, and biofortified crops. Harnessing the potential of beneficial microorganisms and naturally occurring compounds, these bioproducts offer sustainable alternatives to conventional agrochemicals, curtailing environmental contamination and reducing ecological imbalances. Additionally, biofortification initiatives have yielded crops with enhanced nutritional profiles, addressing malnutrition and enhancing food security, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Digital innovation has revolutionized agricultural management through platforms like farm management software, predictive analytics, and blockchain technology. These tools facilitate data integration, supply chain traceability, and market access, enhancing transparency and accountability. Blockchain, in particular, has the potential to curb fraud and ensure fair compensation, particularly in complex global value chains.

These developments have collectively driven the trajectory of agriculture towards increased productivity, reduced environmental impact, and improved global food security, underscoring the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in shaping the state of the art in agriculture.",1692261381.0,

Just thought I'd brighten up your weekends with some doommongering. 

It looks like climate change is kicking in at the moment with unprecedented extreme Spring heatwaves in Europe and India/Pakistan already. Crops are failing around the world because of strange weather patterns and this will lead to huge migration of people in future which will cause all kinds of political problems. 

We will feel the consequences of this in Ireland too given we are a net importer of food, and even our farmed animals rely on imported grains somewhat, especially pigs and chickens. 

I'm 41, my gf wants to have a kid, but I am terrified of the world we'd be bringing them into. 

What's it like to be a young person with all this ahead of us? Do you see any hope?

Governments only want to follow the capitalist machine, and the general population go nuts if any kind of measures that will inconvenience them are announced. 

The fact is we would all have to take a pretty big hit on our opportunities and how we consume if we are to make any meaningful differences. 

The climate is also linked to the destruction of every last bit of the natural world. The Amazon will probably be gone in my lifetime, in Ireland all the metrics when it comes to ecology are getting worse, water quality, birds, insects etc. 

It's not looking good is it?

Today is not only the 10th anniversary of the last drop of rain to fall on Irish soil, but also the opening ceremony of the first of a row of Desalination plants. Finally, after 6 years without fresh water, the Capital is swarmed by hundreds of thousands of refugees returning home, celebrating with freshly brewed pints and water fights.

The year is 2026. Work has finally begun on a Desalination Plant for the greater Dublin area. Although it had been the aim of huge protests to get one built, the final push that sped up negotiations seems to have been that, after 4 years without running water anywhere else in the capital, there were no longer free pints to be had in the Dail's Private Bar.

The Year is 2020. After 2 years of drought on the formerly Green Isle, the Sahara Desert has finally surpassed Ireland in terms of Annual Crop Yield.

The year is 2018. The population of Ireland is stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of being excited to go to the beach, getting sunburnt, then complaining about the heat for the rest of the day before going out again the next day.

yield AND wheat AND ireland,ireland,p5nl08,Irish farmers widely using ﻿glyphosate (roundup) to ripen their food crops,241,0.82,"I was curious why farmers were spraying for weeds late this summer, days/week before it would be time to cut wheat, barley and rapeseed. All for human consumption. I spoke to one farmer and he told me it was glyphosate (roundup), that it helps ripen the crop and reduce moisture content. My jaw nearly hit the floor. In America Bayer agreed to $10 billion to settle existing Roundup suits and we're spraying it on our food!

It looks like farmers are saying it's for weed control, but [teagasc](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/publications/2017/TillageNews-July2017.pdf) post instructions with titles like ""**Is my crop ready for glyphosate? ""** . Even the farmers journal wrote an article trying to tell farmers to cop on. And From my inquiries the practice the done thing for tillage farms in Ireland.

**Edit:** It looks like the comments have been taken over by folks from outside of /r/Ireland who spend all day posting positive things about ﻿glyphosate, claiming there is no science showing ﻿glyphosate's are harmful. While I agree this isn't settled science yet, there ARE studies and evidence from reputable journals and studies that do link it to cancer.
