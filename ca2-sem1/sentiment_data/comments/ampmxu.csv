ampmxu,0,[Not a new idea](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/grass-makes-better-ethanol-than-corn/). [And has been studied for alternative fuels since 1987](https://articles.extension.org/pages/26635/switchgrass-panicum-virgatum-for-biofuel-production),0,,,891,science
ampmxu,1,"And they won’t do it because the government subsidizes food crops for this use and not praire grass. It’s better, but you can’t make as much money. ",0,,,481,science
ampmxu,2,"this has been a story as old as the first plant biofuels. using corn for ethanol ~~costs more in terms of total environmental impact than just digging for oil~~ \**is very inefficient*. all sorts of alternatives have been proposed - pretty much any plant matter can be fermented and used as fuel, not a new technology. but the government wants it to be corn because corn farmers want it to be corn.",0,,,148,science
ampmxu,3,Actually recent full life cycle analysis showed that corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 43% vs petroleum based fuels.  https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/01/12/usda-releases-new-report-lifecycle-greenhouse-gas-balance-ethanol,0,,,79,science
ampmxu,4,"Also since that grass is already in the carbon cycle, wouldn't that mean the gasses count for nothing anyway?  

Plants grow, absorb co2, plants turned into ethanol and burned, release co2. Plants grow again.  

Unlike fossil fuels which are not part of the carbon cycle and so add excess carbon to the system when burned.",0,,,52,science
ampmxu,5,"Energy is required to ferment, transport,  etc. With our current infrastructure this means there is a carbon cost associated with the grass",0,,,48,science
ampmxu,6,"Yeeeeessss however, much of that cost is also a cost associated with extracted oil : exploration, pumping, transport, refining",0,,,10,science
ampmxu,7,That's where the 50% savings comes from,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,6,"The major inputs are fertilizer, planting and harvesting (tractor fuel) transport, then you start the fermentation  and finally transport the fuel to where it is needed. 

It's debatable that we are actually getting a positive energy balance from biofuels. about the best of them are when we have a waste stream which is not being tapped - especially if it is being burnt off anyway to dispose of it. However it's also possible to use those with a conventional furnace/turbine to produce electricity. 

It's always been possible to produce biofuels - there has been a LOT of money spent trying to make more efficient systems with a better energy payback - but the vast majority of them haven't really worked. 

The subsidies have helped but at the same time other technologies have also improved which means they have never gained traction. Why build a biofuel plant when you can instead build a solar farm and turn sunlight directly to electricity at 20% efficiency? The Swanson effect is a powerful force to fight!",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,7,Corn based biofuels were energy neutral at best in the 80s and 90s but recent studies have shown a 2 to 1 and up to 4 to 1 positive net energy balance for ethanol production due to advanced technologies https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-energy-efficiency-of-corn-ethanol-production-has-improved-significantl,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,"huh, hadn't seen that, I amend my position. still though, it uses more energy than prairie grass/switchgrass/etc",0,,,18,science
ampmxu,5,"It does, but the total cost to break down cellulose (switchgrass, etc) into sugars that yeast can munch on and poop out ethanol is much higher than corn.  Corn-based ethanol is probably a net good thing, not awesome or terrible though. ",0,,,8,science
ampmxu,4,"It's great to see an update like this. I've spent too much time trying to explain why previous studies were faulty claiming ethanol was worse than gasoline, etc. but I also hadn't really checked the literature on it much in the last couple years either for updates like this.",0,,,4,science
ampmxu,4,"But what are the water costs? Biofuel is very costly in terms of water, especially compared to wind or PV solar.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,5,"It takes about 3.5 gallons of water to produce a gallon of ethanol which is about the same as making a gallon of gasoline.   As far as solar power goes, keep in mind that there is  heavy water usage and pollutants in the mining of base elements  for the production of batteries for electric vehicles.  Until society can move beyond 2 to 3% electric vehicles we are stuck using liquid fuels for a long time.   And ethanol is currently the best option to minimize greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants that come with petroleum based fuels.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,"One of the most cost-efficient ways of making biofuel is using microalgae from wastewater treatment plants that use algae. However these plants are not very common, and their use in biodiesel production is really the only major selling point of using microalgae over more traditional methods of water treatment. 


Basically, it is very feasible and is a far more sustainable life cycle than current fuel production, but underperforms economically and therefore can't lobby the way the oil and gas industry can",0,,,54,science
ampmxu,4,I wouldn't be surprised if the algae was also helping even more to capture CO². I know it's a tangent but I always like to wonder if using genetically modified algae en masse could be a good solution for capturing it and helping slow climate change,0,,,18,science
ampmxu,5,Could we capture it from the atmosphere with collectors and feed it to the algae for improved growth?,0,,,4,science
ampmxu,6,"I like to imagine a bunch of tanks of algae all stacked into a unit like maximized for surface area, with a constant flow of air from the outside.",0,,,4,science
ampmxu,7,Many algae farms use [tuuuuubes](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee439/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.egee439/files/chlorelle%20_%20Chlorella%20Benefits.jpg) to maximize surface area and ease of manufacturing.,0,,,5,science
ampmxu,8,PBRs aren't all that great either as they get gunked up with algae growing on the light sources or the walls of those tubes. Algae are very sticky. Plus it's energy-intensive.,0,,,4,science
ampmxu,9,"I wonder if a superhydrophobic surface inside the pipes would help?

EDIT: Google says nope.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,8,"I was about to mention the algae farm tubes, thanks for mentioning. I agree and think it’s very feasible. ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,8,Some of the latest concepts use a dam/tank and fibre optics and mirrors to solve the light intensity problem. They were more efficient to build and more efficient per unit of land used than most pipe/bag racks in the study I worked on. ,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,6,"Yes, but the cost of direct air capture of CO2 is still, even with optimistic assessments, around $300/ton CO2. Combine that with the expensive route of turning algal biomass to fuel and you've got a tough proposal economically.",0,,,2,science
ampmxu,5,"It's not easy to modify algae for this purpose, as there is an inverse relationship between growth rate and lipid production. There are thousands of genes responsible for lipid production and modifying the right ones has been tried for many years, with only limited success recently using CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi.

Even when you do modify them for sufficient growth and lipid production, you still have issues growing them outdoors like disease, competing organisms, light/nutrient limitations, etc. Growing them in PBRs is very costly and demanding on energy, with other issues like light limitation due to algae growing and sticking onto light sources and such.

Plus, you need to have several different organisms modified because the lipid profile is just as important for the end product as the total lipid amount. The more long-chain fatty acids in your algae, the better lubricity and cetane number of your biodiesel. More saturated FAs increase cetane number and oxidative stability, but at the cost of cold flow and lubricity, meaning you need more unsaturated FAs for biodiesel used in colder climates, but then your product degrades more quickly due to increased oxidation.

TL;DR at best algae may be used for industrial applications on a moderate basis, but it won't trickle to personal autos at any kind of scale, and like many things in science it's always ""5-10 years away.""

Source: I'm a scientist who worked on algal biodiesel for the Canadian government for almost 8 years.",0,,,6,science
ampmxu,6,"What about the possibility of algae being used solely for carbon capture? As in, we didn't try to burn them, we just let them grow and then deposit them into a low-emission environment? ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,7,"I actually worked on that too, until the price of oil dropped and our industrial partners pulled out. The issues facing that are the toxicity of flue gases used i.e. The NOx and SOx gases need to be able to be absorbed without slowing algal growth too much or killing them, and also absorbing with enough efficiency to be useful at scale. Scale is always the problem with algae as there are problems scaling up past the bench level for most applications. It's more likely to be useful on a wider scale than biodiesel, but I'm unsure of the current state of how genetic modifications into this are panning out, namely modifying them to be more resistant to the toxins we want them to absorb. Like biodiesel, it always seems to be ~10 years away, sadly.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,8,"Whoa, so you actually tried to use algae in power plants? That's not actually what I meant, but it's way cooler.

What I meant is that many people talk about how we will need to eventually capture atmospheric CO2 to bring down our levels. As in, stopping emissions isn't enough and once we have stopped then we need to produce negative emissions globally.

Could you see algae in that role?",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,9,"Well, using the effluent from industrial stacks but we didn't get much past simulated flue gas. Using it for atmospheric...thats a little bit more complicated because you'd need quite a bit of algae and enough surface area to grow it to make a difference. I'm not sure how much you would need to make a dent so I'm uncomfortable guessing.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,5,Actually that happens in my favorite ecosystem: the bog! Basically stuff does not survive too well inside the acidic peatlands of bogs and other wetlands. What this means is that when something dies and falls into a bog it stays in the bog for a very long time before being decomposed and sent elsewhere. This makes them an excellent source of carbon capture (moreso than even old-growth forests) and it is a shame they are often overlooked.,0,,,2,science
ampmxu,4,"I am an algae scientist and let me tell you that it is true only on lab-scale studies. Large scale algae cultures are not rentable for fuel or food. See the prize of Spirulina food supplements, and they are only sold because they are a vegan source of B12. Imagine BURNING that. ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,Even the best assessments put algal biofuels at over 2X the cost of conventional thermochemical or biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass.,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,"Definitely. Plus Almost all prairie is already converted to farm land anyway. The new nuclear plants, solar, wind, and some natural gas is the way to roll. You can do biofuel with sugar but the US doesn’t have a lot of good land for sugar (Hawaii is good sugar land but it’s worth way to much for other things) corn isn’t efficient enough to compete with oil at anything near the current prices of corn and oil.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,"Sugar beets are, per acre, one of the most efficient fuel sources available and grow in much of the US. However, it's not subsidized like corn so...",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,I don’t think Corn has been subsidized since 2011,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,"Actually corn is used because it is very energy dense, can be stored for years, the infrastructure was already in place, and is technically feasible (moonshine anyone?).  As opposed to biomass like grass that has very low energy density, cannot be stored easily,  and the technology is not commercially viable yet.  Three different commercial scale biomass plants were built in the US at a cost of $1.5 Billion USD and two were mothballed and sold for scrap and the other is only producing demo quantities.  ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,doesn't explain why potatoes or other crops aren't used instead. corn takes a shitload of fertilizer to grow.,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,5,"Any food based system faces the problem that the food value is much higher than it's value as a fuel source.

By the time you process that feedstock into ethanol - even more so.

Apart from places where we have a currently unused waste stream, we probably shouldn't be even trying to make biofuels and instead concentrate on other renewables. On the other hand we SHOULD be retrofitting every sewage plant and animal waste lagoon as biogas production. These naturally produce methane anyway which we want to remove from the atmosphere as it's a more potent greenhouse gas.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,What stops these farmers from switching to other crops if the markets make them just as lucrative ,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,"because a) food crops are incredibly lucrative as is partly because b) the government massively subsidizes them in an attempt to stabilize prices and avoid famines and c) the markets do not currently make those other crops lucrative, if it did then they would have switched already",0,,,2,science

ampmxu,3,"Can't the corn farmers just farm something else? Also, why are your corn farmers so bloody influential??",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,3,"Well, yes, but before corn ethanol took off, the gov’t paid A LOT in subsidies to farmers because demand was squishy. That hasn’t happened for quite some time. We want farmers cranking out as much corn as possible: it’s good for the US and places we export it to. ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,">it’s good for the US and places we export it to.

For the US - certainly. For the countries which it is exported to is far more dubious. US farmers producing crops at a price point they can afford because they are being subsidized by the government kills agriculture for local farmers. There is no way they can compete - the same is true for the EU which demands the rest of the world opens it's markets to production but pays it's farmers similar subsidies.

Is it better for these local markets to depend on food produced in the US and Europe than on locally produced food? Perhaps in the short term consumers there get slightly reduced food costs, but if there are ever food shortages worldwide, it's not going to be the west starving, and local production in the rest of the world will have to scramble to try to increase production.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,5,Comparative advantage is a real thing. ,0,,,1,science
ampmxu,6,"US ag is certainly efficient - and might well have actual comparative advantage on a lot of places - however it also has subsidies which distort the market. They have been a bit cleverer recently specifically with the bioethanol thing. It's not a direct subsidy, but at the same time has hugely pushed up demand for a product which frankly wouldn't make much sense without both price supports and mandated usage.",0,,,1,science

I really hope that with the recent farm bill, we see more active effort towards at least looking at it a bit closer.

ampmxu,2,"No, it wasn't the tech.  As I pointed out somewhere else, they tried adding a tiny amount of corn-based biofuels to the gas in a small part of the US, and it ended up using 50% of the country's corn crop.  You'd need all the land on Earth to grow biofuels - and that wouldn't even replace oil completely (and it would leave no land for growing the world's food).

The problem is far bigger than biofuels can solve.",0,,,16,science
ampmxu,3,"Corn isn't even that great of a starting point for biofuels though. The reason it's been used is because subsidies made corn relatively cheap and abundant so there's  already a ton of R&D and infrastructure  around corn.  
That existing infrastructure can't be wholly discounted, but there are alternatives to corn which would produce greater yield per land area, and there is research going with soghum and algae to try and get them to directly produce biofuels.  
  
Rejecting the biofuels out of hand is ridiculous, it's still a very viable path. Pretty much any single product is going to be part of a whole energy system to be sure.   
The fact is that we *will* need hydrocarbon fuels for the forseeable future, and we can't rely on fossil fuels forever. It's better we start figuring out biofuels right now. ",0,,,14,science

They have no interest in seeing a better system emerge - and have a powerful lobby and a decent population of farmers with serious money - which is a strong force in US politics.

We need much more money spent on basic research - I agree biofuels have major potential, but at the minute people are seeing them as being just a political football to keep some people rich. That's why they get so much hate.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,6,"Anything enzymatic is going to perform poorly for a few reasons. 

Enzymes perform poorly unless your feedstock stream is very clean, and it is very costly to clean up these streams to keep the enzyme efficiency high. Corn is a terrible starting point because of the low yield (unless you're processing the whole plant). A lot of biofuels use agriculture residuals which carry a ton of inorganic ash with them which 1) foul the enzymes and 2) destroy your processing equipment via erosion. Lastly, enzyme-based processes are very inefficient at attacking feedstocks which would be cleaner or more ""green"", like just straight up wood.

The woodier it is, the more difficult so short of pyrolysis (which has it's own issues) building a system using a biological basis where we can rely on microbes producing their own enzymes is difficult. 

If we research it enough it should be possible though and like I said, the current system which is more about ""How can we support corn prices"" than ""How can we efficiently produce biofuel"" is deeply unhelpful.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,8,"You can use hydrolysis to breakdown the woody biomass, which doesn't have the same issues as pyrolysis.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,4,"I’d like to add that the reason corn ethanol took off was because of how easily accessible the sugars are in corn kernels. We’re still throwing away the stalks of the corn because cellulosic ethanol has taken so long to advance. We already have pressure built into the Renewable Fuel Standard for cellulosic research, but it simply wasn’t doable yet. 
Corn was a great start because of simplicity but cellulosic is the future. We’ve come leaps and bounds in the past couple of years with producing yeast which can convert the tough fiber of switchgrass and crop waste.

Gasoline is about 5% of energy consumption in the US  and the US is at most 20% of the world energy consumption. This works out to 55 million square miles.

Also, while 40% of US corn is sent to an ethanol plant, only about 27% of corn actually goes into the fuel.  The rest is returned as very high quality feed and corn oil.  ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,6,"While the ethanol tax credit expired in 2011, there are numerous other programs to subsidize ethanol. The main one is the RFS/RIN system that forces refiners to buy from a politically selected list of biofuel suppliers at artificially inflated prices.

The 27/40 ratio is merely the inefficiency of the process. It is like the byproduct petcoke that comes out of the oil refinery stream. It does not change the amount of land needed to produce a ton of ethanol. ",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,7,"The RFS, Renewable Fuels Standard, was set up enhance energy security through additional domestic production of biofuels, support rural economies by expanding the demand for agricultural products, and expand the development and production of second-generation low–greenhouse gas transportation fuels.   It has accomplished all three.  The RIN system was set up to offer flexibility/make the RFS more profitable for refineries by allowing them to decide which facilities are best for blending ethanol.  It is just a tracking mechanism rather than any kind of subsidy.  

The ""27/40 ratio"" is not really an inefficiency of the system and in fact can be argued the opposite.  The feed byproducts from ethanol production (DDG's) are actually a much higher quality feed product than straight corn that it replaces in feed rations.   That is why it is literally exported all over the world and replaces raw corn in rations.   Less raw corn is now required.    While not a one to one replacement, more land for ethanol production equals less land needed for straight raw corn production.  ",0,,,1,science

The RFS was a method to use government force to make people buy a product they would not buy at an fair market price. It is no different than a law saying all breakfast cereal had to be 10% corn flakes. All of your claims are either untrue (corn ethanol does not reduce greenhouse gases) or self-serving (prop up Iowa's economy at the all the other taxpayers expense)

If the RIN system is so honest and fair, why are they priced at huge levels at time. If it is just a tracking mechanism, why have the refiners spent a fortune lobbying to abolish it. It is a way to direct money to a favored gang of RIN owners.

Trying to pretend process losses are not inefficiency is just plain dishonest. If the by product sludge is so wonderful ,why isn't it made without the ethanol production?

Nobody has been killed protecting a corn field vs thousands killed and billions spent protecting mideast oil fields.    RFS did help create about 80K direct jobs in the midwest where population and jobs were in decline, that is a good thing.   Gas with 10% ethanol also reduces the cost of gas by $.20-$.30/gallon (see any local gas stations that sells gas without ethanol) because refiners can use very low quality fuel and blend it with 113 octane clean burning ethanol  vs having to make 87 octane completely out of oil.

I’m not a supporter of ethanol production by ANY means but if we are going to use biofuels I’d be happy knowing they’re using a method that allows farmers to make cash from unused parts of their property and is said to release less lifecycle emissions.

Abstract

The potential benefits of biofuels depend on the environmental impacts of biomass production. High-diversity mixtures of grassland species grown on abandoned agricultural lands have been proposed as enhancing climate mitigation potential, but can have low yields. Intensification might increase productivity, but might also cause negative environmental impacts. Here, we show that, compared with more intensive treatments, moderate intensification of high-diversity grasslands had as great or greater biomass yields, soil carbon stores and root mass, and had negligible effects on grassland stability, diversity and nitrate leaching. In particular, compared with untreated plots, the moderate treatment of irrigation and addition of 70 kgN ha−1 yr−1 resulted in 89% more yield, 61% more root carbon, 187% more soil carbon storage and, if biomass were used for bioenergy, twice the greenhouse gas reductions. Irrigation and 140 kgN ha−1 yr−1 had 32% lower greenhouse gas benefits, 10 times greater nitrate leaching and 121% greater loss of plant diversity than the moderate treatment. These results suggest that optimizing multiple environmental benefits requires sustainable intensification practices appropriate for the soils, climate and plant species of a region.",0,,,11,science
ampmxu,0,"This is not new at all. The main problem is that most processes to generate biofuel use oils and sugar to produce biodiesel and ethanol, and these are exactly the substances that make plants food. People have been searching for economical and environmentally-friendly ways to make biofuels from cellulose, what plants are mostly made of, but to my knowledge there has been no breakthrough there, processes exist to do it, but they are often much too expensive and/or generate too much pollution so that they do not help in the end.",0,,,4,science
ampmxu,0,"This still isn’t a great solution, right? I mean, wouldn’t you still need a lot of land to farm and harvest the grasses? And if you’re going to be disrupting an ecosystem by harvesting the grasses anyway, wouldn’t it be more efficient to just farm one kind of plant that’s already high in cellulose, as opposed to using a bunch of miscellaneous plant species?

Also, while we’re on the topic of biofuels, is algae still a good potential resource? I remember hearing that it would greatly reduce land use for fuel if we could utilize it on a large scale. Is the research not going well?",0,,,3,science

ampmxu,0,"Biomass energy is just a scam to burn up green energy grants and divert that money away from things like solar and batteries and grain based fuel. We have been making grain-based fuels for literally thousands of years and just the logistics of handling the material for biomass fuel production should be more than enough to convince people that it's a waste. Grain flows for the most part like water and can be easily transported with infrastructure that we already have. Biomass materials like corn Stover or elephant grass or any other similar material cannot be transported without using heavy equipment that burns fuel to pick the stuff up and move it around physically, and it is so light that you can't fully load transport trucks to be the most efficient use of fuel for hauling them.

As it grows from the same roots every year again it has much more roots than corn. And as the soil is not moved in any way you save a LOT of energy (ever refueld a tractor after plowing for some hours? I have...) and the biological activity of the soil is increased.

I think, at least at my location, the silphie would be much more economic then grass, but also more envoirement friendly than corn.",0,,,1,science
ampmxu,0,"Hi there, this is my area of expertise. Let me clear up some misunderstandings here.

The important parameter here is fuel per land area per time, which can be increased in three ways: increase the amount of fuel you can get from each individual plant, increase the number of plants that can fit in a certain land area, and increase the number of times you can harvest the crop per year.

Feedstock selection is a very important component of biofuels processes, because it essentially fixes the crop density, the harvest cycle length, and the amount of fuel you can get from each plant. As this research points out, it may also replace food crops. Corn ethanol is a terrible choice because it does not produce very much useful fuel, it can't be planted very densely, and it can't be harvested very many times per year. The other major competitors on the feedstock scene are prairie grasses like switchgrass, and actual forestry stocks like poplar.

Prairie grasses can be planted further north than food crops, but there is only a narrow window before the cold cuts short the number of harvests, making them less useful when planted further north. This research makes it sound like they can be competitive with food-competing crops like corn ethanol, and can do it without actually competing with food. But that isn't the case, because you can only get enough production of switchgrass to compete with corn ethanol when the corn is planted on land that competes with food crops.

The main obstacle to using woody biomass (trees) as a feedstock is that they take some startup time before you can use them. Forestry land must be developed, planted, and matured before there is any payback on the initial investment. Compared to switchgrass, they produce slightly less fuel per land per year once the forestry operation is made sustainable. But unlike switchgrass, trees can be planted so far north as to be completely non-competitive with food crops.

Full disclosure, my work included work on switchgrass, on red oak, and on hybrid poplar. It was focused on getting more fuel out of each plant. I'm happy to discuss this subject further with anyone who wants to.",0,,,3,science
ampmxu,1,">But unlike switchgrass, trees can be planted so far north as to be completely non-competitive with food crops.

I think this is a really important factor that people overlook. Something like the UP of Michigan (especially the Houghton/Hancock to Copper Hook stretch) can't be used for foodstock, but has great potential for commercial biofuel refining in the forestry resources.

Michigan has very little natural energy reserves (poor state for solar, little oil/coal/nat. gas, offshore wind power might be an issue due to freshwater freezing) and imports most of their energy. Being a cold-climate state dependent on the industrial sector, it uses a lot of energy too. Something like forestry biofuel could be a great boon for the state.",0,,,1,science

Corn used in ethanol production only has the starch removed, and the rest of the corn is remaining. The remaining pieces of the corn are dried and made into DDG's (Dried Distillers grain) and fed to livestock. In most cases that corn would have went to those livestock regardless, so the corn used for biofuels isn't completely lost from the food supply..The purpose of biofuels isn't necessarily to produce less CO2 then gasoline, it is to only release CO2 to the atmosphere that was already there. CO2 released from gasoline is CO2 that has been trapped beneath the earth, and is being reintroduced thus increasing the net CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 from ethanol is CO2 that was already in the atmosphere, and was captured by the plant...As for the prairie grass. Most of the land that is fertile enough to grow prairie grass is already used to grow crops we consume. You can grow some grasses in less desirable areas which are either steeper, or rockier then farm land we use to grow crops. Neither of which are advantageous for collecting the grass. Most of the hope for the future of biofuels has been placed in cellulosic ethanol, which involves breaking down cellulose, and hemicellulose by a variety of methods to expose the starches inside. This is ideal because you can use the parts on the plants that would otherwise go unused as a feed source. The problem is it has been a huge failure, and many companies have closed there doors within the past 4 years trying to produce cellulosic ethanol at a production level.
