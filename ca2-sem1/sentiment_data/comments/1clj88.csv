I was working in the Buhasa oil and gas field in Abu Dhabi (Dubai's big brother).  3 pipeline workers hopped into a small ditch to investigate a possible leak.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of H2S gas pooled up in that ditch.  H2S smells horrific (rotten eggs) -- but only up to a point (something like 50 or 100 ppm), and then it kills your sense of smell, misleading you to think the problem is gone.

I know some people use Hydrogen Sulfide, but we prefer Sulfur Dioxide (90% SO2 / 10% bentonite to keep if from blowing all over the place) You can definitely buy it online.  My neighbor used to sell it before they got out of that business.  In small amounts it can come as pure sulfur (ground yellow powder), or mixed with something into pellets (like bentonite). Just make sure it says 0/0/0 for the nutrient content so you don't get it mixed with any nutrients if it comes as a pellet.

Also, you can get it in larger quantities, like 50lb bags, from any CoOp or big box.  Honestly, this isn't really news to me.  Maybe they just discovered it in whatever city this research was done?  Personally, I think it it aids the NTP cycle, because when we treat with SO2 we also add extra Nitrogen... basically, we've found plants suck up the nitrogen when grown in sulfur treated soil.  Our local exchange even gives the recommended sulfur amount along with nutrient recommendations when you ask for a basic test.  It not only lowers Ph, but for whatever reason, plants do better, at least the plants around here.  Be careful though, you don't want to turn your soil into acid.

1clj88,0,"At 1ppb H2S can hardly be acting as a nutrient. More likely it is a signalling molecule, as it is within our bodies.

Does this not mean that the growth of plants is self-regulated?

The usual assumption is that plants grow as fast as they can and that that is dependent on the availability of nutrients. But think about it: if a plant grows too fast, it will exhaust the nutrients in the soil it is in contact with, threatening not just it's growth but ability to sustain it's life. The amount of nutrients washed to the roots and produced by the biology of the soil is finite. H2S, produced by bacteria & decaying organics, is telling the seedling how much nutrients are likely to be around. Enhancing the H2S tells the plant there's plenty and it stamps down on it's growth accelerator.

This could mean the effect of artificial fertilisers is crippled if it does not elevate H2S as well.

1clj88,3,"Well you are spot on in your reasoning - indeed, an increase in supply would cause prices to fall. However, an increase in technology does not inherently lead to an increase in supply, only in productivity, which is different. If productivity increases, farmers can produce the same amount of output they had originally been producing while decreasing the inputs necessary to achieve this level of production -i.e. decreasing production costs. That's the real power of technology. 

As for subsidies, yes, these do exist. In a completely laissez faire economy, if prices ever drop to the point where production is no longer profitable (i.e. strictly negative return), quantity supply would decrease to bring prices back up. How does quantity supply decrease? Well, either farmers begin produce less (which may or may not be believable) or some farmers go out of business and change professions. 

This is where emotion and patriotism enter the scene. In the United States (and to be fair many other countries as well), we have a tradition of ""protecting our workers."" If prices fall to where some farmers would necessarily have to go out of business (as they should in a free economy), the farmers organize and demand subsidies to remain afloat -or else they WOULD SURELY PERISH. The average citizen sees these desperate farmers (or steel workers... or auto industry workers) and typically through some emotional or patriotic reasons, feel like we shouldn't let our own farmers (or other tradesmen) go broke, even if that means chipping in a few dollars per tax-payer to do so. To do otherwise would simply be un-American. Hence, subsidies come into play. Whether or not subsidies are really appropriate is more of a philosophical question than an economic one. They certainly oppose free market forces, however, the free market can also be seen as brutal in that some workers and producers can truly get screwed by market forces.
