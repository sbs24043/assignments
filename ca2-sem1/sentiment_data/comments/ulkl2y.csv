ulkl2y,1,"Would that cause problems for longer trips though? Say you start a crop and then take your year or whatever to get to mars/titan, lack of gravity makes them grow taller, then you enter into the gravity field for your destination. wouldnt that potentially cause the crop to fall over/break stalks?",0,,,43,spaceporn
ulkl2y,2,"Maybe if you land the plants on the planet. I don't know why you'd do that though, these plants are meant to supply the long-range transports and orbital stations that will be required for space colonization.",0,,,60,spaceporn
ulkl2y,2,"Yes, but it's not that big of an issue. If you grew a plant in zero-G, it probably won't survive growing in a gravity well; at least not to the same scale. But you could probably store surplus crops from the trip out and replant their seeds after you land. Plus, we could just add artificial supports to strengthen them, like sticks or trellises. Or we could even put a garden in the crew compartment that would grow crops in spin gravity.",0,,,41,spaceporn

ulkl2y,4,"I'll admit, I'm an aerospace engineer, not a botanist.

ulkl2y,1,"I think the affects of low light are being ignored here. Lower light results in etiolated plants (spindly) that grow tall in search of light. They look bigger, but dont have as much biomass. What matters here is dry weight. Dehydrate them, and compare that to plants grown in identical conditions but with stronger gravity.

Also, capillary action is not ""stronger"" in low gravity. You mean to say that lower gravity makes the *affect* of capillary action greater. The force of capillary action remains the same. 

In my plant physiology courses we were taught that gravity essentially has no affect on water or nutrient transport through plants because capillary action and osmotic potential contribute so much more to fluid movement. Thats why those those topsie turvey things for tomatoes are a scam. They claim gravity will aid nutrient transport but the plants orient themselves rightside up against gravity anyway. I have never seen a healthy plant in one of those.

There are many other factors that limit plant growth, and gravity is not one of them.",0,,,12,spaceporn
ulkl2y,2,"What if they employed a screen of green technique from cannabis growing?

This can even out the canopy and help maximize uses of things",0,,,3,spaceporn
ulkl2y,3,"Id never heard of this, but it seems a bit sensational. From a brief search it seems there is a ""screen of green"" method used to get light onto the buds to improve harvest quality and a ""sea of green"" method which is supposed to improve growth.

Both seem like buzzword names for trellising plants, or binding them upright somehow. Although that might help a little, higher light intensity is what is most needed. That would create greener plants that didn't ""want"" to grow as tall and thin",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,4,"Yeah, sorry, I often misuse scrog for sog because SCROG is a cooler acronym.


Specifically my point:

The trellis or screen makes the plants canopy even and let’s you lower the light depth penetration requirement of your led’s and that translates into saved space and energy 

We also have to consider:

Gassing the chamber at all times with high class concentrations of c02 or whatever the plant gas is.

And utilizing micro misters to the smallest micron size and highest grade aeroponic nutrient mixes. 

And using led’s on the sides or reflectors or rotators or other systems. 

Personally I’m a fan of robotic controlled high tier shelving style aeroponics.

Each tray is the size of a baking sheet tray.

It’s a self contained root chamber and sprayer system. 

The tray above sits on a rack floor that houses led’s with exactly the light depth of the tray belows plants. 

Each tower can fit 20-30 trays and robotic tray lifters can pluck any tray out like in rogue one and take them to propagation chambers or cloning chambers (like plant cloning we have now by taking cuttings from one plant to grow into 3 more) or harvesting chambers.

These harvesting chambers could be automated or human ran, and then the tray is harvested and reloaded and it is taken and replanted with clones or new crop starters, and back to the tower of aeroponics trays. 

When aeroponics systems start being shaped like server stacks, and requiring some of the same heating and cooling and power and water draws as server farms, you find a lot of the work is already done for you, engineering wise. 

Just put a custom server room in space.

I guarantee you an aeroponic cannabis growing expert would accelerate their program by decades.

Oh yeah, the server stacks have micro fans, and air currents help strengthen stems, and you can selectively damage some plants to stunt their growth and push them “wide”",0,,,3,spaceporn
ulkl2y,2,"Like I said, botany isn't my field of study. I appreciate the input from someone who knows about it better than I do!

I'll admit, I did miss a few of these details and I would like to clarify a few things. I meant to say that capillary action is ""relatively"" stronger compared to gravity in zero-G. On Earth you barely would notice it. But without gravity it's effect is huge, even on large scales. 

Also, when I said ""bigger"" it was mostly focused on the non load bearing parts of the plant; such as leaves, fruits, and flowers. If the overall biomass was the same, wouldn't these features become larger because the plant was dedicating less biomass to stems, trunks, and branches? And would this be beneficial since more growth is dedicated to its parts we want to use?",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,3,"The statement about capillary action is still using logic and not reality. Xylem is the cell in plants that carry water from the roots up to the rest of the plant. That cell type dies, but still functions from capillary action. The wood of trees is made from xylem. Redwoods are still able to carry water hundreds of feet into the air using capillary action and osmotic potential by creating a gradient of ions between the leaves and trees. Drop the gravity subject as far as capillary action is concerned. Bluntly, its wrong. Especially over the short distances of anything that would be grown in space as food.

But, your statement about reallocating resources that would typically go to stems or cell walls, has merit. Plants do have mechanisms for detecting gravity to orient themselves upright, and that is auxin collecting on the downward sides of stems to increase growth. There may be other ways plants determine how much sugar to use to create cellulose and lignin.",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,1,"Huh, I always thought that xylem and phloem needed gravity to flow",0,,,2,spaceporn
ulkl2y,2,"In all technicality, neither need gravity. 

Xylem is transported upwards by capillary action and through evaporation of water on the surface of the leaves from the stomata. Due to the cohesion of the water molecules and their adhesion to the cell wall there is a constant flow upwards. 

Phloem always moves from the sites of production to the sites of consumption (source-to-sink). No gravity is needed here because diffusion and active transport with the Saccharose-H+-Cotransporter does the trick.",0,,,8,spaceporn

ulkl2y,3,"Skylab and salyut stations grew plants in space in the 1970s. ISS had the veggie module since  2014 and grew vegetables and flowers. That photo is about the first time growing plants in the ""advanced plant habitat"" they sent up recently.",0,,,2,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,Nice.,0,,,1,spaceporn

ulkl2y,0,Mmmm yummy plants from a gamers PC,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,"I for one am more looking forward to more robotic orbiter and probe missions to the outer planets and their moons. Growing wheat in microgravity is cool and all, but I think of this more like r/lowearthorbitporn",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,Hey there.,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,So freaking cool!,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,"Honestly: I saw the photo and at first wondered why there were plants in a 3-D printer. This is great news, though.",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,It must be refreshing for the astronauts to have something green and living to look at up there. It must get to depressing at times being so far away from earth in a little tin can with no greenery to look at.,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,They don't look quite ready to harvest yet though but I suppose they will,0,,,1,spaceporn

ulkl2y,0,"Oh hey, I think I worked on an early prototype of this year's ago in high school. Super cool to see its actually getting used!",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,Lol that’s a relief knowing even plants do better in space getting away from all the bs on earth 😌,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,"Finally, they can grow space weed.",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,"I wonder what long term options exist for plant growth in space. The big question is: where will plants get their nutrients? There will either need to be a mini ecosystem that can produce nitrogen, phosphate, potassium and calcium (among many others), or nutrients will need to be packaged and brought along for the trip (like hydroponic liquid nutrients).",0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,Better than the plants I’m growing on my patio,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,Woah...,0,,,1,spaceporn
ulkl2y,0,It would cost about 4 million dollars to get the average mill-stone into space so this is dumb ^^^/s,0,,,1,spaceporn
