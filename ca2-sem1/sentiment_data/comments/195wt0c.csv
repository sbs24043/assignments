195wt0c,0,so you did bootstrapping and resampled your data. Why not apply Monte Carlo with these data to forecast 2024 ?,0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,0,"Right so bootstrapping has certain uses, eg empirically estimating a standard error without assuming a particular distribution.

However, it doesn’t replace standard methods such as the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean.

If you want to assume a mean yield size and estimate that, bootstrapping won’t help as the number of real observations you have won’t change.

Bootstrapping might help to determine forecast errors, but I would suggest looking into econometric modelling and domain knowledge to ascertain what causes changes in yield size.",0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,1,"Ok, thank you",0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,0,"You have only four data points, two of which you say are garbage and not represantive of the population. Bootstrapping, or really any other procedure, is not going to give you any prediction that is particularly useful. But it should not be surprising if the estimated standard error becomes smaller when you start removing outliers or replacing them with the ""true"" mean.

However, note that you should be estimating the standard error of the mean by sd(bootstrapped_means). Also, keep in mind that the confidence interval is meant to cover the mean yield, not a predicted value of a future yield. A prediction interval would be much wider. There is presumably some way bootstrapping could be used to produce a prediction interval, but the problem of such a small number of observations (half of which are known to be exceptional) still persists.",0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,1,"Gotcha, thanks",0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,0,"Statistically, honestly you are trying to derive too much information from four observations, two of which you want to dismiss.

Agronomically, of course there are several factors that vary from year to year.  And there are several factors that vary from field to field.

So, assuming that this field is in-line with the fields in the area, and that 2023 is in-line with other years, I think the best you can say is that this field and these management practices will likely achieve the area average of 1600 lbs/ac.",0,,,1,AskStatistics
195wt0c,1,"Thanks for your input. This is just one example of many fields that I will be assessing. There will be a lot of fields where the yield data are 'normal' for all four years and we will use the average of them to predict the following. I used this example to provide a rarer case and to prove/disprove my reasoning where prediction is more difficult. That said, would you have any suggestions as to alternative methods? Or just stick with the region average?",0,,,1,AskStatistics
