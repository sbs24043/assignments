**Impact of Bt Brinjal Cultivation in the Market Value Chain in Five Districts of Bangladesh**

>Eggplant (brinjal) is a popular vegetable that provides an important source of income for small, resource-poor Bangladeshi farmers. The biggest constraint to brinjal production is the eggplant fruit and shoot borer (EFSB). This study was conducted in 2019 in five districts in Bangladesh and examined the impacts of using genetically engineered, insect-resistant brinjal (Bt brinjal) on its value and marketing. Based on a survey of Bt and non-Bt farmers, results indicate that Bt brinjal provided an average of 19.6% higher yield and 21.7% higher revenue compared to non-Bt varieties. On a per tonne basis, the revenue benefit of using Bt brinjal was 1.7%, reflecting different levels of acceptability among trade buyers and consumers. Some were prepared to pay higher prices for Bt brinjal compared to non-Bt brinjal because the fruit was less damaged, while others paid a price discount because the Bt brinjal was not available in preferred local varieties. Labor use, expressed in 8-h days, for harvesting, grading, and packaging of Bt brinjal was 14% higher for Bt brinjal, reflecting the increased yields of Bt brinjal. 83.1% of Bt brinjal growers were satisfied with the yields obtained, and 80.6% were satisfied with the quality of fruit. This contrasts with non-Bt brinjal growers where 58.7% were satisfied with their yields and 28% indicated that a large portion of their fruit was infested, not a concern for Bt brinjal. Three-quarters of Bt brinjal growers planned to plant Bt brinjal next season because of the apparent benefits achieved of higher yields, revenue and fruit quality. Many also highlighted the benefits of reduced insecticides. Of the non-Bt growers, 39.6% had not heard of Bt brinjal. However, after hearing more about the impact of the technology, 71.4% of them indicated they planned to grow Bt brinjal next season. These findings suggest there are significant benefits of Bt brinjal and highlight the importance of making the technology available in more varieties that are suitable to local conditions and consumer preferences. Additional studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and explore in more detail the factors influencing decisions made by farmers and consumers regarding Bt brinjal.",0,,,2,science

gs5kli,4,"Do you know how BT plants work? They produce The toxic protein Bacillus thuringiensis normally produce. the protein is called CRY, so now you have CRY inside a plant. We have science that says yes we donâ€™t need to apply CRY on top of plants. We do not have science that says eating CRY or having plants that produce CRY is GRAS over the long term. 

Hereâ€™s a good article outlining and highlighting thereâ€™s a net reduction of pesticide applications. Looking forward to good science supporting safety of eating en masse BT produce for several generations of humans. ðŸ‘Œ

gs5kli,0,Ask the right question. Who owns the copyright to this modified seed? This is a step towards Monopoly.,0,,,-6,science
gs5kli,1,"Farmers can freely share it.

Maybe you should ask the right questions and actually look up the right answers.",0,,,5,science
gs5kli,2,No please look into who is selling these modified seeds to Farmers. A natural seed is nature's resource hence can't be copyrighted but this can be.,0,,,-3,science
gs5kli,3,"You are wrong, and you should stop spreading misinformation. I know this project well.",0,,,3,science
gs5kli,4,"Ask yourself can these modified seeds be obtained naturally by the farmer just like original seeds, and the answer is no. At least, think for yourself if only one company or institution will make these seeds, doesn't it sound like Monopoly, since modified crop seeds can be copyrighted. Indian supreme Court has a case going on this very issue. 
Since you re saying this is misinformation, then be a gentleman and cite your argument against my proposed questions with some documentary proof.",0,,,-3,science
gs5kli,5,"You need to stop making baseless claims about this. You don't understand this at all, and are spreading misinformation just as bad as any anti-vaxxer. 

The way this works is that you are making an claim and have not delivered any shred of evidence. The onus is on you to do so--that said, I know you can't because it's false. 

I don't have to ask anything, because I have the facts. I'm going to give you the facts, too, despite your failure to deliver any evidence. I don't think it will affect you at all, but you will now have to face that you are wrong and are actively misinforming others with your lies. 

>Bt brinjal is Bangladeshâ€™s first GM crop and the first publicly developed GM food crop in South Asia. Bangladesh approved the crop in 2013, following nine years of research, and it was introduced to farmers in 2014. Bt brinjal was developed through the  Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant Improvement Partnership, a collaboration between the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), the University of the Philippines at Los Banos, Cornell University, the Cornell Alliance for Science and the US Agency for International Development. The technology was transferred to BARI for royalty-free distribution to farmers, who can freely save and share the seeds.

Now that you have the facts, you have 2 choices. You can stop lying about this, or you can keep lying about this. Which side of history do you want to be on?

But let's say you can admit you were wrong. Will it affect you at all? I bet you $10 it won't, and you will just move the goalposts to some other baseless claim. 

I'd be delighted for that to be not be the case. But let's see.",0,,,5,science
gs5kli,6,"The private sector has considerable experience developing and bringing GE crops to market while meeting the regulatory requirements of a particular country. In most cases, (except GE papaya in Hawaii), it has been a company that has produced seeds for the GE crop and then sold them to farmers. The private sector (including NGOs involved in commercial seed operations) has not yet but could be a significant partner in the long- term development of Bt brinjal in Bangladesh and future crop innovations. In the seed industry, the private sector is considered to be efficient at developing and scaling quality seed. Once the Bt brinjal technology is made available to the private sector for commercial multiplication, the private sector may readily move forward to develop their own Bt varieties, including hybrids.

e) Since BARI is a public research institution, the MOA remains the ultimate authority to determine the way forward for Bt brinjal at the farmers' level. The technology was approved four years ago, and our partnership is in a good position to work with the MOA to develop a well-defined work plan for full commercialization. A comprehensive work plan with appropriate roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders will help ensure the sustainably of Bt brinjal. The event developer (Mahyco) and other stakeholders in the private sector should be part of this discussion. The role, as well as the responsibility, of the MOA in guiding the way forward of the technology is pivotal. We believe that our project can help facilitate this plan.
