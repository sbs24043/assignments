9tlc13,0,Wouldn't companion planting decrease the need for pesticides as well?  Is there much enthusiasm for this method in western nations?,0,,,100,science
9tlc13,1,"Absolutely. They don't typically use pesticides in West Africa, which is one reason why this bioirrigation method has so much promise. Not sure this is directly applicable in western nations because these shrubs aren't native here, but there could be other plants out there with similar benefits, I suppose.",0,,,73,science

9tlc13,4,"True. The intelligence of the agroforestry systems of native North Americans was so subtle that European invaders only saw wild forest in them.  
It is also argued that Europe had its own agroforestry as well, but most of it has been lost to ""progress"".

9tlc13,3,While that's true the vast majority of US agriculture is done on industrial farms hundreds if not thousands of times larger then your average mom and pop farmers farm would be. So while other parts of the world do use machinery very few use it on the scale that US farms do.,0,,,6,science
9tlc13,1,Depends how it scales. If a farmer has to devote 50% of his fields to a crop that doesn't make as much money as his cash crop he needs to save more then that by not using pesticides. If he only has to devote 10% of his fields the equation changes alot.,0,,,3,science
9tlc13,2,"No, if polyculture can increase yield by 900%, even if the 900% only referred to the main crop area, then using up 50% of a farm with unsellable crops would still yield 4.5x the revenue...

Even 80% unsellable crop land usage would still be a large net profit in that situation.",0,,,11,science
9tlc13,3,Your assuming it increases the yield of every crop by 900%. Just because it increases the yield of millet by 900% doesn't mean it will increase the yield of potatoes or soybeans or corn by 900% it might only be 400% or 600% or 200%.,0,,,1,science
9tlc13,4,"Yes that's why I said ""if""

But we only have one example number given to us here so why would we be hypothesizing with others, specifically? I don't actually know if 900% is particularly high or low, so 900 is a good baseline for now",0,,,5,science

9tlc13,3,It could but it also might not like the African shrubs in the article aren't going to be adding much value to a field by themselves.,0,,,1,science
9tlc13,0,[deleted],0,,,14,science
9tlc13,1,"A 900% increase sounds fairly incredible, but that's terrific news.  Is this mainly because millet production was really anaemic in these areas, or was it actively boosted beyond 'normal' levels by co-planting with guiera?",0,,,8,science
9tlc13,2,"The incredible seeming result is due to plants thriving in community, not as monocultures.  In this particular case, the woody shrub has deep roots which can access water during drought that the shallow-rooted millet can not. What we are realizing about plants (or perhaps rediscovering after intentionally forgetting) is that they communicate and share resources with the other life around them, plants, microbes, and fungi. I bet if you added two more plants to that millet mix you could increase profitability even further. 

(I say an ambiguous two plants because I don't know if you want to go in to details on cool-season vs warm-season, broadleaf vs grass, and how having one of each of the four types together works to make them all healthier)",0,,,10,science
9tlc13,3,"I don't disagree per se, but my understanding is that the main obstacle to polycultures in developed countries has been the difficulty of integrating these practices with agricultural machinery and processing.  It's conceivable that improvements in robotics- or just a ready source of very cheap labour- might change the picture, however, and the latter certainly applies in much of the developing world.",0,,,1,science
9tlc13,2,"The millet production without irrigation was pretty anaemic, but that doesn't make it less interesting.  The point is that millet has a relatively shallow root system and so in the arid environment of the Sahel it doesn't normally produce very much without irrigation.  But the shrub plant they used here has a much deeper root system that can access moisture deeper in the soil and at night it releases some of that moisture to the upper soil layers thus making some of it available to shallow rooted plants like millet.   In this specific case it's just enough to lead to some spectacular increases in productivity for the millet.

That kind of increase isn't generalizable, but it illustrates one of the reasons that polycultures and agroforestry are so interesting and their tremendous potential for reducing inputs in the form of irrigation, fertilizer and presticides when used intelligently.

&#x200B;",0,,,4,science
9tlc13,3,"Oh, I don't mean to diminish the importance of the results in any way- given the Sahel is one of the most drought/famine-prone regions of the world, even localised gains in food production/stability would be of immense benefit.  And I'm in total agreement that polycultures/agroforestry are well worth investigating.

I am a little curious about the relative depths of the root system, though.  Pearl Millet, based on what I've read, already has quite deep root systems, and that's the variety most indigenous to west africa:
https://www.nap.edu/read/2305/chapter/7#91

Were the researchers studying a different millet variety, or is it that even millets can't compete with perennials' root development?",0,,,1,science

9tlc13,7,"I said much of the amazon was planted by human hands. The article says

>In 2013, community ecologist Hans ter Steege and colleagues were taking inventory of the vast diversity of the Amazon's trees. The team sampled 1,170 scattered plots far from modern human inhabitants to identify more than 16,000 different species among those 390 billion individual plants. Then they noticed something odd: Despite that broad diversity, over half of the total trees were made up of just over 1 percent (227) of the species.

Instead, because of political/economic pressure in addition to religious beliefs (go forth and multiply), that will NEVER happen.


As a result, I do believe, especially with all the antibiotic resistance and the higher population densities from their being so many of us, there will definitely be a super bug at some point.  


It will suck.  People will lose all of their loved ones.  But I think it's inevitable at this point.

I'm relatively optimistic about the future, especially if ITER's predictions about the energy yield of their fusion reactor are true(achieving true breakeven point, where energy in=energy out.

You're in r/science, there's a strict definition for carrying capacity. There is sufficient space and energy for the Earth to sustain a trillion people, assuming you're using land efficiently (people in cities, food mostly in greenhouses). That statement says nothing about a trillion people being a good thing, but it means proposals of population control are *probably* trying to ignore/bandaid actual problems.",0,,,3,science
9tlc13,4,"To be clear, this isn't a scenario of how the Earth will ever be. It's a way of putting into perspective how inefficient we are with resources, and how the problems with society are *not* some physical limitation imposed by thermodynamics.

**To add some context on how people reach that calculation:**

An American's energy usage is pretty high worldwide, at [10,000 watts](http://insideenergy.org/2017/01/12/energy-explained/) per day. Food is negligible at 130 watts (the average American apparently eats frickin [2700 calories](http://www.farmlandlp.com/2012/01/one-acre-feeds-a-person/), I don't know why). That means a trillion Americans is 10^16 watts. Solar energy hitting the Earth is 10^17 watts, and solar panels are currently about 20% efficient. So we need to cover 50% of the Earth in solar panels (and still have room for our greenhouses and megacities).

So 50% of the Earth is going to be solar (man, this would be easier if we had [self-deploying space mirrors](http://jxcrystals.com/publications/Self_Deploying_Mirrors_Solar_Power_from_Space_10-7.pdf)).

**How densely can we pack our food?**
Today, the order of magnitude given is 250 fed people per km^2. That only gets us to 100 billion even if we used the whole surface area of the Earth. But that's also in the context of Americans raising hamburgers on farmland.

If we switch to greenhouses, we can [pretty reasonably](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9582/how-many-people-can-you-feed-per-square-kilometer-of-farmland) get to around 10-20,000 people per km^2. That means we can feed our trillion people using 50 million km^2, which is just 10% of the Earth's surface.

**Now for housing.** I went with the population density of Manhattan, since I'm using Americans-- there are significantly denser cities. Manhattan has 25,000 people/km^2. That means a trillion people is 40 million km^2, or just under 8% of the Earth.


So altogether my trillion meat-eating Americans (well, it's either lab meat or it's hydroponically grown soybeans) are taking up **68% of the Earth**. The ocean is 71% covered in buoyant solar panels and the land is either millions of tiny Manhattans or one Ravnica-esqe megacity. We've still got room for some national parks, though!",0,,,6,science
