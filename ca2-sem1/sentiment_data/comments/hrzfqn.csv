We get an average of about 20-25 inches of rain a year. Our limiting factor was never lack of fertilizer, or any other cultural practice. It was water. Well now the rainfall has stayed the same, but crops are made to use water more efficiently (especially corn).

You look back even 20 years and no one planted corn. It was wheat and sorghum, because that's all we had the water to grow and it could take the 100⁰ heat we get damn near every day of July. Corn couldnt do that, it would burn up. And this was even after we switched to no till. So the only possible explanation is genetics.

hrzfqn,5,"Another (less intelligent than you) conventional farmer could produce more grain than you off the same acres you farm. You just choose not to because there's a diminishing economic return at a certain point. Organic farming has a different curve, but we also can push yields when it becomes incentivised. No one is farming for max yields, we're all farming for max returns to equity. Big fuckin deal, you get more grain per acre. When food costs enough that it matters at all this beaten to death strawman will carry some water.",0,,,-1,farming
hrzfqn,6,"Ok I dont know whether I'm just exhausted, or what, cause I cant fully understand what is it you're trying to say. 

I think you're saying that yield doesnt matter because money is what we're after. And while you're technically correct, theres more to it.

No matter what yield you are shooting for on a certain crop it takes the same amount of fertilizer per bushel. So let's say you want to raise a 100 bu/ac corn crop, that's gonna take 112 pounds of N per acre. Now let's say you wanna raise a 200 bu/ac corn crop, that's gonna take 224lbs of N per acre. Both times it takes  1.12 pounds of N per bushel to produce both the grain, and the plant itself.

 Now let's say that Urea costs $360 a ton. That's 18 cents per pound of urea. Now urea is 46% nitrogen, so its roughly 39 cents per pound of N. And it takes 1.12 lbs of N to make 1 bushel of corn. So you're Urea inputs are about 44 cents per bushel of corn. So as long as the price per bushel of corn stays above 44 cents, it will always pay to put on more urea. 

Now that a only a partial picture, but to look at the whole picture, you have variable costs (like the fertilizer example) this includes fertilizer, seed, trucking, rent based on shares, etc. these are costs that go up as you raise more grain. Then you have invariable costs, this includes cash rent, herbicides, etc. These costs do not go up as you raise more bushels. 

So my point being, if fertilizer was the only limiting factor on yield, it would always pay to raise more.

Now we get to the part where you are technically correct...

Think of all your plants needs as a barrel, each board represents an individual requirement of your plant. If one board is broken off half way up the barrel, it doesnt matter what all the other boards are, you can only fill up the barrel half way. So it makes sense to figure out what your limiting factor is, see if you can improve it, and adjust accordingly.

For instance, in my area our limiting factor is water. So it makes sense for me to do everything in my power to use all my water efficiently. That is where organic vs conventional comes into play. Because GMOs give the crop herbicide tolerance, it allows me to use herbicides to better control weeds. Whereas with organic I dont have that. I have some herbicides I can use (some of which are more toxic than the ones I currently use) but they do not give good enough control on problem weeds. So my only other option is tillage.

Tillage is detrimental to soil moisture. In the short term it exposes moist soil to the sun, baking it and drying it out. Long term it reduces my water holding capacity. By introducing air and mixing the soil around, tillage allows microbes to rapidly begin breaking down organic matter in the soil, this loss of organic matter lowers the water holding capacity, because organic matter acts like a sponge, soaking up excess water that the soil particles cant hold onto. It also exposes the top of the soil to rain, which you'd think would be a good thing, but actually is the opposite. When a raindrop impacts the soil, it causes silt to form a thin waterproof later on top of the soil, keeping any further water from infiltrating the soil and causing more runoff and more pollution of our waterways.

So farming organically would lower my maximum yield capabilities, now whether or not the premiums you get for the grain make up for the loss in yield is a whole another can of worms. But my guess is it doesnt, otherwise everyone would be organic.

TL;DR just read the whole fucking thing, I put alot of work into that.",0,,,5,farming
hrzfqn,7,"Yeah, you really did put a lot of work into explaining how MRTN works and why fertilizer doesn't provide a linear response. I guess you missed the part where I acknowledged the curve of diminishing yield: costs, and said we just happen to be on different curve (Ever put $4/lb N and $12/Bu corn into an N rate Calculator? I have) and didn't say fuckall about fertilizer anyway. If you wanted to win an NCGA contest you're pushing a stupid amount of money to maximize every yield factor from water to weed control to boron. But you don't, you just want to make a living and no one is getting all morally upright and saying we can't farm the way you do because you're missing max potential yields by 30-40%. Guess what? Organic farmers are doing the same thing and our numbers put us off another 25-35%. You can argue till you're blue in the face but the 'yields' are not the difference. The costs of inputs and production vs net impact on income dictate what we're willing to spend chasing yield.

&#x200B;

>I have some herbicides I can use (some of which are more toxic than the ones I currently use)

This is such literal horseshit I'm willing to send you enough money to pay for a 6 pack if you can prove it. I guess you meant pesticides which I wouldn't call out but most organic herbicides are basically food ingredients, i.e. corn gluten meal and acetic acid, and literally none of them are cost-effective for field crops which is a much bigger part of why you wouldn't use them than resistant weeds.

Tillage is the wooden stake in the heart of the organic vampire. I fuckin know about tillage and No-Till is IMO the most important contribution of GMO crops. I'm not anti-gmo, haven't said a goddamn thing about it yet and you can go as far through my comment history as you need to, I'm consistently nonpartisan about the tech and think it makes agriculture better. I could not farm the way I do without my neighbors planting bT. I was right there with all of the conventional guys saying anti-roundup litigation is an insanely scary prospect for agriculture last year. But there are plenty of people who use GMO's and still till, and there are lots of areas (perhaps even more of the corn belt, it sounds like you are dryland) where no-till results in better returns but not better yields because of slowed soil warming and drying and tie-up in surface residue that weathers aboveground rather than where microbes can get it. Just a few weeks ago there was a paper here everyone was surprised about claiming there were no long-term differences in SOM in no-till vs conventional management over time. So it's not as cut and dried for every farm that tillage=bankrupcy. Anyway, yeah, tillage blows. It's why we grow corn 1/5 years. It's why we have living cover crops in the soil over the winter in all but one year of our rotation. We can get 2-3 no-till establishments in a rotation, like wheat into buckwheat stubble, usually with a yield hit that corresponds well with our neighbors when they no-till say, wheat after corn silage. We're all playing the same game with different numbers.

I live about a half mile away from a rural food pantry that sends about 5 tons of food to a pig farm every week because it doesn't get used despite the line of 30 late-model cars that pile up on Wednesdays and Saturdays before it opens, and the people who volunteering there pushing boxes of produce on their friends and everyone they know who aren't needy. I can drive by a few hundred acres of 25 year fallowed fields with brush growing up within 20 minutes of leaving my house. We're growing enough food, We've got the space, we're making a living, never understood why yield had to be such a religion for some folks.

Not necessarily you, but it's something everyone preaches as the reason why for a lot of things we 'can't do' but the reasons we aren't are mostly obscured by the need for simplicity and always return to money and politics.

Also, we have to differentiate between these two topics, GMO Crops and then the separate topic of the safety of chemicals used on those GMO crops. I am fully in agreement that GMO plants by themselves do not pose any significant dangers to human health. However, it's not the genetically modified crop that I'm concerned about, it's the fact that glyphosate is being used. If, for instance, there were a genetically modified crop that was made to withstand natural pesticides/fertilizers and not the need of a synthetic chemical, you wouldn't hear a peep out of me. The focus here, however, is the safety of glyhposate.

That's simply not a valid comparison to me. You say it's *needed* but that's clearly what is being debated, so you are trying to win the argument by pre-empting the conditions of the outcome. Clearly, it is a ridiculous statement to say that ""without glyphosate, there is absolutely NO other path (organic or not) to survival in terms of feeding the human race."" Please don't confuse this for me automatically saying that glyphosate is not a possible solution, however the logic that you are putting forward to argue that it is the only solution is irrational.

Because it centralizes control of our food supply. The best example of food system centralization of which I'm aware comes from communist countries. It prevents or reduces the ability of farmers to save seeds or cross well-established cultivars.

Private companies could still function without patents. It might reduce their long-term financial return on investment, but they could choose to run in order to improve the world. It's entirely possible for a new technology to recoup its costs without patents, and doing so makes the tech spread faster and accelerates further research. But generally, public universities and non-profits should be doing this research and seed development.

How many farmers do you know who farm because they want to get rich? Non-profits aren't expected to work for free, but they're not profit-driven. Farming is already heavily subsidized.

No, they should be able to. Computers are optional luxuries that people don't need to live, and private companies are well-suited for making consumer goods affordable.

You cannot just plant the same crop you harvested last year. Have you ever noticed that volunteer crops usually look smaller or even sometimes are not even herbicide resistant?

If breeding seeds requires such expertise (and it does), then patents are not necessary to ensure that their services are needed and profitable.

But no, I find that my volunteers tend to perform as well as, or even better than, the original plants.

I'm sorry what? Do you even know how many truck loads of seed it takes for 1 farm to plant? Are you seriously thinking that somehow a few land grant institutions can provide hundreds of thousands of bushels worth of seed to farmers? What on earth are you on? 


Patents are necessary to recoup the investment made to develop that product. I'll give you an example. I work with a company that is currently trying to find out which specific genes code for size in Oats. This has been a project that has been going for years and costed around hundreds of millions of dollars.

Why is it always about Monsanto?

The patent for glyphosate ran out in 2000 and since then it has been sold under thousands of brands and produced by all sorts of companies. But it's all about Monsanto. Not NuFarm, not Sinochem, not Brunnings, not Hortico, not Yates, not any of the other producers or sellers.

hrzfqn,3,">Evidence is increasing to show Round up causes cancer.

Nope.

The IARC classified glyphosate as Category 2A, or ""probably carcinogenic in humans"". But there are two things wrong with this.

1. That classification system does ***not*** say whether or not something *is*                   carcinogenic; it classifies them based on the quality   of           evidence.    It    also doesn't base it on how much is   needed  to   be        carcinogenic  or   the    likeliness of you   getting  cancer,   just  the       quality of the    evidence. It is not   a health  risk    assessment,  it's a    hazard classification.
2. It does not have to be shown to be carcinogenic in humans to be in 2A. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer):

>\*\*Group               2A : The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans.\*\*There   is         limited     evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and   sufficient            evidence in     experimental animals.   Occasionally, an agent  (or        mixture)    may be     classified   here when there is  inadequate   evidence      in humans but       sufficient evidence in  experimental   animals and      strong evidence   that the      carcinogenesis is mediated   by a  mechanism     that  also  operates in     humans.   Exceptionally,   an agent  (or  mixture)      may solely be  classified    under  this   category if  there is    limited    evidence  of carcinogenicity  in     humans,   but if  it    clearly belongs  to    this category based on       mechanistic      considerations.[\[11\]](https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Preamble/CurrentPreamble.pdf)

Other               things in 2A include red meat, beverages above   65°C,     and             shiftwork that disrupts circadian rhythm; all   things   you     likely       encounter in ***far*** larger amounts than you do glyphosate.

3. There are [some problems](https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreykabat/2017/10/23/iarcs-glyphosate-gate-scandal/#43d1fd851abd) with [that classification.](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/)

Are you trying to argue that the ruling was a statistical outlier? That if we were to re-run a similar case in court that on average it would have returned a not guilty verdict for whoever was in Bayer's position?
