A groundbreaking study by researchers from The Australian National University (ANU) and the University of Newcastle (UoN) has unveiled the inner workings of a key enzyme found in cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. This discovery could pave the way for developing crops that can absorb carbon dioxide more effectively and yield more food, contributing significantly to climate resilience.

Cyanobacteria, while notorious for their toxic blooms in freshwater environments, are much more than just aquatic nuisances. They are microscopic powerhouses that play a crucial role in Earth's carbon cycle. Each year, these organisms capture approximately 12% of the world’s carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, helping to regulate our climate.

The enzyme at the center of this research, known as carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase (CsoSCA), is vital for maximizing the ability of cyanobacteria to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This process occurs inside specialized protein compartments called carboxysomes, where CsoSCA teams up with another enzyme, Rubisco, to transform the absorbed CO2 into sugars that nourish the cell.

Sacha Pulsford, a Ph.D. researcher at ANU and the study's first author, highlights the efficiency of cyanobacteria. Unlike typical plants, these organisms have developed a sophisticated system to concentrate and convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars at a rate far surpassing that of common crop species.

Dr. Ben Long, lead author from UoN, explained the novel insights gained about the CsoSCA enzyme. The researchers found that CsoSCA's activity is regulated by another molecule, RuBP, which acts like a switch. This interaction ensures that carbon dioxide conversion to sugar is finely tuned to the availability of RuBP, much like ingredients are gathered before making a sandwich.

The revelation that CsoSCA is activated or deactivated by RuBP depending on its abundance helps explain the incredible efficiency of cyanobacteria in carbon fixation. This mechanism, embedded in nature's design, had eluded scientists until now.

The implications of these findings are profound. By engineering crops with a similar capability to concentrate and convert carbon dioxide efficiently, agricultural productivity could be significantly enhanced. This would not only boost food production but also reduce reliance on nitrogen fertilizers and irrigation, making farming more sustainable and less resource-intensive.

Ms. Pulsford said, ""Understanding how the CCM works not only enriches our knowledge of natural processes fundamental to Earth's biogeochemistry but may also guide us in creating sustainable solutions to some of the biggest environmental challenges the world is facing.""",0,,,6,OptimistsUnite
