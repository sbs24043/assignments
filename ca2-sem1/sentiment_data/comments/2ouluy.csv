2ouluy,1,yeah not sure why they are trying to play off the 20% as if its a small disparity. ,0,,,7,science

2ouluy,0,"Your submission has been removed due to a sensationalized, editorialized, or biased headline.

From the abstract of the actual paper:   

>We find organic yields are only 19.2% (Â±3.7%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. 

Therefore a headline heavily implying that is doesn't is substantially misleading.  This is also an opinion peice from the huffington post, so it's not shocking that it's a bit sensationalized.",0,,,24,science

2ouluy,1,I knew posting a huffpost article on r/science was a bit risky! But my title is absolutely factually correct. The gap is 6% smaller overall which is a big change. Whether that is considered 'much smaller' as I the titles says is subjective but I'd say it does.,0,,,-3,science
2ouluy,0,"Would those authors then care explain why organic produce is so much more expensive?

Edit - before anyone jumps in with the ""subsidies"" argument - I'm talking about a worldwide phenomenon, not a USA specific one.
",0,,,5,science
2ouluy,1,"I haven't researched this a ton, but I think that organic food is more expensive because of the costs associated with attaining and maintaining organic certification. Also, organic food items are usually comprised of pricier ingredients (real sugar instead of cheaper alternatives like modified corn starch).  Also, I'm sure it requires time and labor to seek out organic ingredient suppliers and to avoid ingredients like: bleached flour, sulfates, GMOs, etc.  Expenses associated with organic certification and verification for programs like the Non-GMO Project can mount quickly. I would love to get involved in the organic industry, but profit margins would be slim and, as a small start-up company, I would not likely capture enough of the market to contend with larger competitors. 

Edit: Added ""would""",0,,,6,science
2ouluy,2,"You're right on all counts but there's even more to it then that.  In organics you also have a paper trail that has to be flawlessly maintained.  When you set down organic products they have to be only set down on approved surfaces that have been cleaned and tracked as being organic safe. 

Also, preservatives and such can not be used.  So, the products spoil faster which means you cant produce as much as you otherwise would (something that cuts down on cost).  You also lose more in transit, you loose more to pests because you cant use most pesticides. 

Because of all the extra steps organics take much more labor hours to handle and track so that adds up.  

An additional level is organic animal products.  They have to eat organic food to be organic so that multiplies the cost.  

You mentioned some of this stuff, I was just expanding on it and adding some more. ",0,,,1,science
2ouluy,1,"To be fair this article is not dealing specifically with organic farming practices but rather with agroecosytemic methods that may or may not be in of themselves organic. Obviously they tend to work out that way, but the two categories are definitely seperable.",0,,,1,science
2ouluy,1,"Part of it I think is that because organic food is such a small market compared to conventional food, it struggles to make use of the huge and efficient distribution system which conventional food uses. Shops usually stock a lot less organic produce and so are less able to buy in bulk like they can with conventional produce. 
Also, organic farms practicing agro-ecology aren't able to grow vast mono-cultures like conventional farmers do which means they can't take advantage of cost saving machinery like combine harvesters etc. This means there is more labour involved and hence a higher price.
But I think the main reason is that there has been so little investment and research into organic farming techniques. Conventional agriculture has had billions and billions spent developing ever more efficient harvesting and planting techniques, machinery and other cost-cutting technologies. As a result food costs have gone down more than ever before in history but organic has been left behind unable to take advantage of these advances and hence unable to lower prices.",0,,,-2,science
2ouluy,1,"Much more expenisve as what? Organic is supposed to be high quality food. Are you going to ask why a Mercedes is much more expensive?

",0,,,-4,science
2ouluy,0,"One of the realities of this industry is that ""Organic"" standards are subjective. I know a company that has USDA and OMRI certified product and neither has visited the factory to ensure those certifications are in fact really organic. The whole ""organic"" standards were built by the farmers.

A lot of what is listed as 100% Organic in grocery stores are not really 100% Organic. Most ""Organic"" farms still need to use some chemicals and ""some chemicals"" are okay to get the ""Organic Certification"". For the most part if you are shopping at a grocery store then you are being sold. Smaller grocers and most farmer markets have higher standards.

2ouluy,1,Even after subsidies it probably wouldn't be cheaper but imagine if all the billions been spent trying to make conventional mono-cultures slightly more cost-efficient were spent researching and refining agro-ecological methods. I think we would see the price lower significantly.,0,,,0,science
