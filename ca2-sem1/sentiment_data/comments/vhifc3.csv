The young ducks are raised this way until they're around five to six months old, when they'll return to the breeder's farm to lay eggs for a few years or to be sold as meat.""

vhifc3,0,"This is cool. My father had similar stories involving his grandfather's farm - said they would release chickens during the day in certain fields to eat all the bugs, and they would eat insects exclusively until the pests were mostly gone. You'd think they would just eat everything, but no, they liked their protein first. Once the chickens started pecking at vegetation they'd be lured out with chicken feed and sent elsewhere.


Also, their dog... Great grandpappy was mostly a subsistence farmer, but he made money off of a pecan grove in the front yard. (and tobacco, but that's not relevant to the story I'm about to tell)

Now, squirrels will decimate pecans if given half the chance. This is where the old man's dog comes in. Buddy, if he saw a squirrel in the trees, would start raising hell and run back and forth under whichever tree that little arboreal rat was in. Day or night, rain or shine, it didn't matter. My great grandfather kept a .22 rifle on the porch, right next to a big cooking pot filled with oil. If the dog was making noise, the old man would dash out there, pick up the rifle, put eyes on what his dog had located, and immediately shoot the squirrel out of the tree.

Sounds cruel, but that was his money, y'know? 

Anyways, Buddy would gently pick up the dead squirrel and carry it to the porch. After dropping it next to the pot and rifle he'd sit and wait patiently for grandpa to light a fire, clean and skin the little pecan thief, and drop it in the pot until it got just a little crispy. A few more minutes for it to cool down and Buddy had one hell of a doggie treat.

You better believe there weren't any squirrels in those pecan trees without someone hearing about it.

Edit: a bit of grammar and spelling and such. Also, this is a first attempt at storytelling in writing so suggestions and criticism are really appreciated. I think I want to start doing creative writing. Genuinely, please tear this little tale apart. It would do wonders for my confidence in the future if I know what I can do to improve what I write.

Edit2: This post is in honor of a fine redditor who responded to a silly writing prompt I came up with. It's definitely a true secondhand story, though. Also I've made like 6 small edits at this point",0,,,29,Damnthatsinteresting
