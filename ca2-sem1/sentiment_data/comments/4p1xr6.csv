>And their techniques for growing plants are not even that great. With proper training, they multiply their cucumber yields by 14 for example.

I can't agree with this more. I did some research awhile back looking at the cost-benefit for various technologies in different regions. For less developed regions, the benefit of transgenic crops (which I am a fan of in general) pales in comparison to the benefit of educating farmers on techniques and providing basic tools &ndash; e.g. tensiometers to measure soil moisture. 

One example that doubly proves this point is rice farming in Punjab &ndash; the breadbasket of India/Pakistan with one of the most dire water/aquifer crises on the planet. If Punjab rice farmers flooded their rice fields every three days instead of daily they would **triple their yields and reduce their water usage by 67%**... from doing LESS work...

You alter these conditions by a small fraction and you have crop failure or low yields, or the weather doesn't co-operate.
Moving them from warmer areas they can no longer survive in to areas that were once cool can yield a crop, but often there are other problems, like weather, to contend with.  Weather patterns in cooler climates, as they warm, can become erratic. What would work best is to take existing non-related hybrids (from seed banks) and interbreed them with what we have to create better suited varieties.  Still, this takes many, many years. In the interim, we may be able to prevent food shortages by using varieties from the past that were grown to struggle through harsh conditions and produce.  The only problem with this being that such varieties often do not have the yields of our current super crops, because they have not been so closely line-bred/genetically modified in a lab.

It's a bit of a complex issue, I hope this helped explain.",0,,,135,science

4p1xr6,3,"In a word, yes. Crops can grow in areas they were not field tested for, but funny things happen. (For instance, my family's farm grows brassica (kale-type) greens from Guatemala.  We are far from Guatemala in both temp and longitude.  However these greens grow amazingly well. But we have a shorter growing season and even with the last five abnormally hot years, the greens 'bolt' (go to seed) much faster than their southern counterparts.  And this is with 80-90F days, an ideal range for this crop.  The nights are still cooler, there is probably less rain and humidity, and the sunlight is not the same, so these are likely influencing factors.)  We also have an Ethiopian eggplant variety that loves it here in the high tunnels, who would have guessed?

Speaking of sunlight, the further north or far south you get, light levels change.  Some crops (certain types of onions, melons, and corn) are light (day length) sensitive, and require periods of darkness that northern locations may not be able to create without artificial means.  The more one delves into this, the more you realize just how amazing it is that anything grows in places it was never bred to live under, and why crops engineered for specific conditions suffer.

It takes money and time to prepare the now-warmer areas to be agriculture-ready.  That delay could mean food shortages.

Apparently the circuit they ended up with they couldn't understand how it worked. It had random wires connected to nothing and different grounds and all sorts of goofy things. But the biggest issue was they found when they built the circuits again, they didn't work. At all.

That makes sense. Thanks. So we need new plants for new environments. Or older varieties which are adapted to a broader range of climate, but have lower yields.",0,,,2,science
4p1xr6,3,"Yes.  Older varieties are not inherently bad for their lower yields either, and some yield quite well and would do even better under modern fertilizing methods.  They are just lacking in *intensive* breeding, because often selection criteria for their survival, throughout the years, has been dependent on farmers saving seed and planting what survived (there are literally hundreds of area-specific corn varieties, all looking as different as you can [imagine](http://www.seedweneed.com/index-1.html)).  Farmers, then, were selecting for traits and producing better plants, but their methods were not as focused as a team of ag scientists growing acres of corn and specifically locking in only a small handful of traits.  Farmers of the past could never compete with modern crop scientists for speed, nor did they select for things like ""ship-ability"", which can influence flavor. This is why many people don't have a problem with GMO crops, because you are merely speeding up what nature(and crop scientists)* would have done...something we may find ourselves required to do as the Earth changes.

As for needing new plants for new environments, China comes to mind.

4p1xr6,2,"I imagine there's also soil issues with moving to previously cold areas, in regards to composition, acidity and available nutrients (?)",0,,,1,science
4p1xr6,3,"Acid and alkaline soils can influence crop growth (or death), as can soil composition. As an example, tomatoes need an acidic soil to avoid things like blossom end rot, but it should not be too acidic.  Farmers amend their tomato fields with lime, or Epsom Salts can work for home gardens (helps with nutrient uptake), in overly acidic areas to balance ph. In the north the soil tends to be naturally more alkaline (cooler soils are).  The warming of the soil in the summer raises the acidity, but it's still poor soil when most plants like a little more of an acidic environment. Would global warming make it more acidic?  Yes, but it would probably still be lacking.

Some areas of the north have silt-based soils (basically very tiny pieces of stone all ground up, and not much in the way of loamy, crop-growing, earth).  These soils must then be fertilized either chemically or organically.  This isn't too terribly different than what is already done in the mid-continent U.S. to grow vast amounts of corn and soybeans without crop rotation, so if the infrastructure was in place this could be less of a problem.  At current, the further north or south you get, the more you must rely on artificial means to ensure proper compost break down, if going the organic route.  Even with warm air the soil is frigid, and areas with permafrost start to show up with frequency the further you go.  Now, in the event of a global warming trend this would become less of a problem, but it still might present small issues with yield.

This is just an overarching explanation, there are small microclimate areas, and coastal soils are different, but generally, even with warming, you would have poor soil in many places.

There's also an issue of sunlight recieved. Many of the plants are photoperiod sensitive and are somewhat resistant to being moved further north or south.

Then there's more complicating environmental factors like soil type, precipitation, and agricultural infrastructure availability. Even things like transportation matter.

To put it more simply, in the form of a metaphor, Plant breeders have been operating with a weak flashlight in a house with no lights.

If there was a bigger push for the expansion of public breeding programs like ICARDA, IRRI, and CIMMYT, with research programs independent of current food prices, but more focused on long term, steady, and reliable budgeting, it could go a long way towards long term selection.

Why do we even need to grow crops outdoors in this day and age? I really figured we'd have indoor urban farming working pretty well by this point.

Also, what is up with this big stink about GMOs? Aren't all crops genetically modified to begin with? The fruits and vegetables we buy at the store hardly resemble the same plants that existed before human intervention. Why is altering genetics so bad when we have been doing it for more than 10,000 years?  We can just do it quicker and with better scientific understanding of the plant.
