1bnhu2l,0,"I am pretty skeptical about this claim.  I think corporations are the reason why food prices are rising.  Ever since COVID prices have gone through the roof and corporate profit tracks with those rising prices.  They claim it's supply issues but if that was the case the profits would not be going way up as it would be costing the companies that make/process/sell the food more to get the food and the profits would stay either steady or be reduced.  
  
>The study didn’t look at why prices rose, but the likely explanation is that extreme heat is reducing yields  
  
This sounds like they are just making an assumption that because the temperatures rose along with the price of food then that means the temperature rise was causing the food price increase.  Those two things could be happening totally independent of each other as there can be two things going on at the same time that don't have an impact on each other.

Many of these factors are negatively affected by higher CO2 and the ensuing temperature changes. From a global food security/food systems perspective there are no such “right locations.”

There is a broad consensus in academia and the industry that the warming and associated impacts caused by higher CO2 outweigh the basic impact on photosynthesis that you mentioned by far.

The 'acceptable range' from the perspective of the crop is considerably higher than the worst-case-scenario projections for the planet over the next 100 years. 

> we’re facing soil degradation, unpredictable weather patterns, extreme weather events, pressure on water reserves, new pests

We're not seeing those in a vacuum either. They don't occur equally in all locations or to an extent that universally outweighs technological gains as evidenced by ample yield data.

1bnhu2l,8,">No one claimed otherwise.

The person I was originally responding to did. They said ""more CO2 will technically be better for plants"" and ""crop yields will be bigger with warmer temperatures as long as we have enough water supply"". Those are pretty definitive statements that imply that CO2, temperature and water are the only relevant factors and that crop yields respond in a linear fashion to those.

>The 'acceptable range' from the perspective of the crop is considerably higher than the worst-case-scenario projections for the planet over the next 100 years.

Assuming all else is equal, which it is not. There are also two separate things here - tolerance for the CO2 itself and tolerance for the 'side effects' of increased atmospheric CO2. As I alluded to, there is a multitude of these side effects and many crops are already showing signs of stress.

>We're not seeing those in a vacuum either. They don't occur equally in all locations or to an extent that universally outweighs technological gains as evidenced by ample yield data.

We're seeing negative trends across most, if not all, of these indicators. Taking soil as an example, about [a third of soils worldwide are moderately or severely degraded](https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/FAO-world-soils-report-SUMMARY.pdf), rising to as high as two thirds in places like Europe. This is a long term trend and to the extent that soil is a non-renewable resource, 'technological gains' (not exactly sure what you are referring to) cannot indefinitely compensate for this even in the absence of climate change.

The reason I mentioned **global** food security in relation to this is because our food systems are highly complex and interconnected, with a huge concentration on just a handful of crops. The things I mentioned don't need to occur equally in all locations to cause shocks. They need to happen with sufficient frequency across a wide enough range of areas - which they are.

>ample yield data.

Yields are not a useful predictor of food security. Physical availability of food (=yields) is just one pillar. Access, utilisation, and stability are equally important and all are showing worrying trends. Even if we did take yields to be a useful indicator, [there are biophysical limits on gains and evidence of plateaus](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3918), which are compounded by climate change.",0,,,2,science
1bnhu2l,9,"I'll have to limit my response since I'm on a work call now. I acknowledge there are many factors at play. 

> 'technological gains' (not exactly sure what you are referring to) cannot indefinitely compensate for this even in the absence of climate change.

[This data on US corn production says otherwise](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Field_Crops/cornyld.php). The US grain belt has to deal with all of the issues related to climate change: soil degradation, weather inconsistency, challenges with water resources, and more. Yet production is up more than 40% while acreage has remained flat. This trend is consistent across most of the grain crops. You might say that ""yields are not a useful predictor of food security"", but I disagree. Food security has an absolute floor if the food simply isn't there so it is at least useful in predicting scarcity. On the other end of the spectrum, yes, more food doesn't necessarily mean all the people who need it will get it. That's a logistical and political issue that is entirely separate from climate. 

We're getting very far from the original thing I commented on. If we start talking about CO2 relative to yield and you bring us to global food security the goalposts haven't just moved, they've left the stadium.

I'm also not wanting the world to be completely dependent on imported produce to survive, I'm just an armchair observer, but I think the ideal would be for food production to be as decentralized as possible. The Montreal area in Canada has businesses that are able to grow produce year-round in greenhouses. I don't know how scalable the model is, but I've used the services, and found them to be quite good, if more expensive than the cheapest options.

Most of all however, I really think people need to get more comfortable with certain foods being unavailable or difficult to obtain in the off-season.

In the places I've lived (Canada), imported produce is thorougly integrated into our diets. While I don't think there's much inherently wrong with this, the ""cold chain"" that makes the storage and transportation of these products possible is a significant contributor to greenhouse gasses and CO2 emissions. If/when any of these crops fail, or become unavailable for other reasons, Canadians will have to habituate themselves to produce that is better suited for our climates, and which can be preserved during the winter as opposed to being imported from elsewhere.

What I am not okay with are major grocers and distributors making money hand-over-fist and still jacking prices up, citing research like this. Since the pandemic, food costs in my country have skyrocketed to laughable levels, and get the major chain that supplies the vast majority of food has posted record breaking profits for the last 4 years.

1bnhu2l,0,"Small scale (local) farming with an emphasis on native ecosystem crop diversity is the only method of farming that is viable in the future. We have to replace large scale monocrop farming before it is too late. Put power back in the hands of generational farmers, not giant corporations and power hungry billionaires.

At the very least, food shortages and price hikes might incentivise people to start growing their own fruits and vegetables again. It is entirely possible even in an apartment with no windows thanks to hydroponic setups like the aerogarden.",0,,,1,science
1bnhu2l,1,"A massive shift to small-scale (local) farming would result in extremely expensive food. I say this from my small-scale, sustainable farm.


Also, 96% of today's farms in the US are family-owned and often generational. Family-owned farms produced 83% of all agricultural products in 2017 (the most recent data).


Lastly, it takes ~200 of square feet worth of hydroponic space to provide just the vegetables for one person. It would likely require thousands of square feet to meet the calorie needs of a single person.
