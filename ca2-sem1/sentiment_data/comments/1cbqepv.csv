Moved and had to leave a hive once for 1.5-2 years. They were still buzzing along when I went to get them. Of course they were jam packed full and had burr comb everywhere with everything glued shut. I’m sure they split their self many times.

I’m the world’s worst beekeeper. Sometimes I just don’t have time and I run behind on splits so I get a swarm every now and then. If I’m home I can get em and put them in a nuc box. 

I also don’t treat for mites which may be looked down on. They’re not one of my top problems. Wax moths, dearth’s and the time to give them what they need at times are my top issues. Wax moths get in a weak/small hive because I’m giving them too much room to take care of, entering a dearth and didn’t feed a lay split. 

A dearth I can’t do anything about except feed them. Last year was dry and they didn’t put up enough honey for themselves. They should’ve been fed in the fall but I didn’t get to it and it got too late. So Nov/dec I took top cover off, laid some paper down and spread some sugar on top. They’re all doing great this spring!

Tomatillos are nice and easy. They are raised as annuals in my zone 4a garden, but you just direct seed them and they go. Pretty brief time before they're producing too, as early as a couple months depending on varietal, and they are indeterminate so keep producing as long as it's warm.

1cbqepv,0,"Some ideas for combining several species, though not exactly ""low maintenance"". Move the beds one up every year for continuous good harvests. So, if you have 1-2-3... this year, plant 2-3-4... next year and so on.

1. Tomato/garlic/basil/celery: One row of tomato plants (whichever you prefer); For pest control, put two garlic cloves between two tomato plants like this O:O (O= tomato, . = garlic). One row above the tomatos, plant basil (better taste for tomatoes, or so I've been told). The row below the tomatos, plant celery (also good for pest control). Since basil, tomato and celery are all quite allergic to frost and need to be planted rather late in the season, you can use the space for an early harvest of various lettuces, spinach or may turnips. Extra kudos if you use New Zealand spinach as a living mulch. If you're not into celery, go for garden leek - preferably a variety that can be harvested late (autumn or winter), as those also get planted a little later.
2. Peas and lettuce: Sounds... like not much. You're wrong. Peas get sown rather late, and don't grow too quickly, giving you a good amount of time to plant an early fennel variety, may turnips (the greens are edible and are actually cooked where I'm from), an early variety of kohlrabi or various lettuces.  While that stuff is still growing, you need to grow your peas either indoors or in a greenhouse. They are planted after the last frost - where I'm from, that's around May (middle/end). Since peas can be quite fickle, you might want to try different varieties, including some edible Lathyrus species (peavines, vetchlings) or even chickpeas. Note that not all peavines are edible! Once the peas are harvested, you can - once again, plant various lettuces, preferably in combination with garlic. (Yes, giving your lettuce a head start outside their final bed is a good idea...)
3. Now, a bit of care for your ground (in case you want to keep going for many years): Plant some marigolds of the Tagetes species, some sweet lupine (yes, there are some edible varieties out there...) and some garlic. Marigolds are good against nematodes, lupines are good for nitrogen, and garlic keeps various pests away. And you still have a bit of a harvest...
4. Cabbage family bed: One row of an early kohlrabi variety - cultivate in advance, they'll stay pretty small unless planted into the soil - then plant, wait 8-12 weeks, harvest, plant the next young plant - and you have a continuous supply of kohlrabi. From March to April and June to July, you can use may turnips instead (the taste is similar, but the turnips are ready to harvest after 4-8 weeks already). One row of broccoli. Do not replace this with cauliflower, because the broccoli can be harvested and grows back. If you try that with cauliflower, it will just rot. Put one row of celery in between and use all free spaces in-between for garlic or onions. Even if you won't get a harvest out of the garlic or onions, they're good pest deterrents. You can also put some radishes betwen the celeries for more variety.
5. Carrots and onions: One row of onion, one row of carrot. Repeat until the bed is full. Onions keep away the carrot fly (and most rabbits), while carrots keep the onion fly away. Which means that this combination is a match made in heaven. If you use an early variety of carrot, you can have two harvests (sow February, harvest in May, sow again in June/July, harvest in October), but those carrots cannot be stored for long times (unless canned, dried or the like). If you use scallions as your onion of choice (in one row, at least), you can harvest them before July and leave the place open for some parsnips in the next row. Parsnips need quite some space, so having the scallions by their side (and then vanishing - yum!) will do the parsnips some good. Once everything is harvested, consider planting some extra garlic, onions or spinach and leave them over the winter. (Spinach is good to keep the soil moist and ready for the next generation of plants)
6. It's been three years since the last ground care year, so here we go again. Phacelia is a great plant to give some nitrogen to your ground, and Borage is great at getting minerals from far down in the ground back up. Ideal mulch...",0,,,3,preppers
1cbqepv,1,"Continued:

7. Bell pepper and cucumber: Both are - once again - highly averse to frost, so start with some lettuce early in the year.  Cultivate peppers and cucumbers early in march (inside or in a greenhouse), then plant them by the end of May. Peppers go well with basil, cucumbers with dill. Keep in mind that cucumbers can climb trellises if you help them a little bit. You can try New Zealand spinach as a ground cover, too. And the ever-present garlic to deter pests. Once you brought in your harvest sometime in September, you still have time to plant buck's horn plantain, miner's lettuce/winter's purslane, lamb's lettuce (Valerianella) or spinach for an early spring harvest.

8. Chickpeas, fennel and soy: Just as said. If you want to make life hell for slugs, plant some small nasturtiums around the fennel. Once you got your harvest in, plant some onions and spinach.

9. Time for some ground care... You needs mostly *Raphanus sativus* var. *oleiformis*, which helps against harmful nematodes. The fruit can also be pressed to get oil. Add some (sweet) lupines for some nitrogen, too.

10. three sisters: Before you start with the actual three sisters (corn, beans, pumpkin), you can have an early harvest of salads and/or early radishes or, well, spinach. Then plant (pre-cultivated) corn, runner beans and pumpkins. Since this is draining for the soil, you might want to plant a winter-cultivar of lathyrus latifolius.

11. Sweet potato: Before you actually plant the sweet potatoes, which you need to cultivate some time in January, you can plant some fava beans, lettuce and garlic. While you have to keep the fava beans around, they mesh well with the sweet potatoes. And, yes, after the harvest, you can still plant the usual suspects.

12. Ground care, again. Just sweet lupines (the edible varieties...), some onions in between and maybe some borage if you like.

13. Potato: Before you start planting your potatoes, you want to have an early harvest of, well, the usual suspects (radishes, asia-salads, various other lettuces, spinach...) Between the rows of potatoes, you can plant the occasional caraway and fava beans. If you use an early potato variety that you harvest during the summer, you can still plant some (pre-cultivated) lacinato kale.

14. Beans - because beans are great for confusing the colorado potato beetle: Plant all your runner beans of choice - like ""Blauhilde"" (purple), ""Borlotto"" (white with red speckling) or whatever. Non-green varieties are easier to harvest because they're harder to miss. (This is especially true with the three sisters, too.) Add some savory in between the beans. 

15. More ground care: Something against nematodes again - there are mixes you can buy for just this purpose. I just don't know what they're called in English. XD

But if you want truly low maintenance: Go for fruit and nut trees. Seriously. Maybe not the walnut tree (due to allelopathy). But trees. Bushes underneath. Some smaller plants underneath the bushes. Yes, this is basically a food forest.",0,,,1,preppers

We literally do nothing except pick up free calories off the ground (and tree/bush in the case of Hazel). We grab enough to snack on all year, but it doesnt amount to a month' calories. We can 100x that by simply picking up more.

A single American Hazel tree/bush will throw off 1 to 3 days calories for an adult, depending on cultivar, fertility, and conditions ... and we have hundreds upon hundreds of them on The Homestead.

These keep me in sweet preserves year round, but don't really take care of my nutritional needs as much as I'd like,  Great for trades/bartering though.

For annuals, I really want to suggest corn, potatoes, and tomatoes, like I'm seeing a lot of other folks recommending...but at least where I live (a desert) those are very high effort plants.  The corn takes a lot of space and water to yield anything calorically significant.  The potatoes and tomatoes and prone to disease and bugs.  

For easy yields, I have the best luck with Blue Hubbard Squash, bush beans, and kale.  The squash yields multiple 30-50# squash per vine, and it keeps fooooooreeeeeever since its rind requires an axe to open it up.  Bush beans can and freeze well.  Kale blanches and freezes on sheet pans really well.  I almost never have pest or health issues with these plants.  So long as you water them regularly, they yield a good amount with minimal effort.

Garlic has been a new set-it-and-forget-it for me.  Plant in fall, let it overwinter.  I've watered mine twice since November, and I'm looking to get \~100 heads out of my two beds.
