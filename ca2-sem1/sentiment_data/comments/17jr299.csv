17jr299,0,"Brewmaster here AMA. The temperature alone is causing the cooling system to go to its limits and using more energy. 

What is more fascinating the temperature at which starch dissolves in the mash was around 62°C. The optimum off the enzyme to adjust the sweetness of the beer is at 62°C.
Since a few years and due to rising temperatures the dissolving temperature of starch is rising because the starch particles are getting smaller and more robust in the grain.
We are at 64-65°C now and this was only in the last 10 years.

The problem is, should it continue, the first enzyme controlling sweetness in beer is destroyed at 68°C .

It would make it impossible to make non sweet lagers without adding artificial enzymes.",0,,,18,science
17jr299,1,"Were those types of beer just not made pre-industrial age then?  Because obviously beer and has been made long before any electricity was even an idea.  For a much smaller population to be sure.

Has energy, the abilty to produce highly specialized equipment, and the abilty to ship/share ingredients change beer brewing dramatically do you think?",0,,,7,science
17jr299,2,"The beer taste you know is not that old. Beer was very different before we got into the science of it. 

The malt was roasted directly over coal a long time so the beers were heavy on the smokey side.

Since we have pressure vessels it is possible to have naturally high carbonated beers like lager or pilsener.

With open fermentation it was not possible to bind as much. 
Also now we know a lot about yeast and how to adjust the temperature to make it develop specific flavours and keep off flavours out.

We actually learned a lot about the off flavours in beer, what they taste like, how they develop and how to avoid them.
For example if you want the ale yeast to bring out the banana side you need a special yeast strain and higher temperatures. 

So yes to you question, the flavour of beer is not the same as it was 100 years ago.",0,,,7,science
17jr299,1,"Wait, you mean that the polysaccharides in grain themselves are beginning to alter as a function of their ambient environment?",0,,,1,science
17jr299,2,"Not the polysaccharide in the grain but the starch grain in macrostructure. 
This is a starch grain: https://moticmicroscopes.com/blogs/articles/food-microscopy-starch-grains

To get to the starch with your enzyme these grains have to dissolve in water first.

That happens at a specific temperature, depending on the size and structure of the starch grain.",0,,,3,science

So what you are observing is more of a function of surface area shift?",0,,,1,science

17jr299,0,"> Bruce says that temperature and rainfall are a big part of that, which directly affect hop aroma and flavor. “It’s difficult to predict, but that could noticeably alter the aroma and flavor of beer. There’s already seasonal variation in the same variety of hops, but changes in the climate could exacerbate them.”

> Bruce was quick to specify that though the exact outcome is uncertain, bitter beers likely aren’t going anywhere, as brewers can adjust the amount of hops they use to maintain bitterness. But that’s much more difficult to do with the unique aromas of different hop varieties

> If warming temperatures cause decreased crop yields, Bruce said that price will likely be another factor affected.

>“In the U.S. most hops are grown in the northwest. If the study is correct and drier climates reduce hop yield there, it will likely cause prices to go up. This could have a disproportionate impact on smaller craft breweries, as they tend to use only one to three types of hops in their beer,” said Bruce.

17jr299,0,"I attended a special presentation by some lecturers on global warming, and biogeography issues.

17jr299,1,"You seem to have significant gaps in your education, you might have missed important classes during school.

Luckily, there are some free resources on the internet where you might learn those things and make up for it. It's ok, you can always learn regardless of your age, there's still time for you to catch up.
