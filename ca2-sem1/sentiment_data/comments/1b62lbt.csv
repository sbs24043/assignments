1b62lbt,0,"I'm not a farmer. I just have a very small hobby farm in Maryland USA. I have bees and fruit trees and grow grass to feed my animals. 

Winter of 22/23 was not as cold as normal and I (and others in my local bee club) noted infestations of small hive beetle during summer of 23 when in the past I had none. We think the milder winter did not kill off the hive beetles. Then the expected slow down of available nectar in late summer seemed longer than the past years. I only had 4 hives and lost 2 outright. And combined my last two and then fed them through the winter 23/24. 

The mite treatments I used in the late summer did not work at all. I switched treatment and did a late fall treatment but I could not test the hive to see if it worked. So far they made it through the winter. 

My fruit and veggies did great summer 23. I partially think this is because of my increased bee hives and aggressive pruning of old fruit trees. 

I started some baby trees last spring and they have had a difficult time thriving. 

I had to have some 100year old trees removed and I have lost some in the wind storms. I asked the arborist what to plant and they said it is getting tought to plant trees that will grow large. So many are falling to blight, disease and insects. Partially they believe climate change is causing it as the trees cannot adapt to the hotter temps. 

I experimented with planting a live oak. I am at the northern end of it's normal range, but we are thinking it might have a chance since it has been getting warmer. If so, that tree will be my legacy as it hopefully grows strong and outlives me. 

High winds/storms are more intense. Barns and buildings that have stood over 100 years are getting their roofs peeled off in the storms. There have been more tornado warnings and events in the past 5 years than in my over 40 years living  in the area. 

When it does rain it is a lot at once and the ground cannot absorb it. A few days later the earth has cracked open from being so dry. 

Spring and summer of 23 I did not mow my horse fields and let them grow tall. This gave me food in place for my horses and greatly lessened the earth cracking open and becoming hard as a rock. 

I keep the lawn around the house at 4 inches.  This has helped with controlling moisture and runoff.

I'm concerned that keeping animals in the pasture is going to beat the hell out of it. Essentially I'm seeing them disturbing the soil/roots which weakens plants so they can't survive the freeze and second mud in the spring.

1b62lbt,2,One year was a late frost that killed the blossoms which made it not worthwhile to pick. Then there was a heatwave that sun scalded everything on top of the trees and caused the rest to prematurely ripen so they were half the size they should have been.

1b62lbt,0,"Some good, some bad. My fruit crops have been good, and the price I can get for cherries has skyrocketed. 

But it is so much dryer, with more large flooding events per year. Not enough snow overall, which has lead my main water source for irrigation to dry up seasonally - I'm praying it was a one off, but I expect this is only the beginning 

I'm lucky where I am that I have a spring fed source to switch to (current is glacial fed... from an Icefield that is quickly shrinking). 

I'm lucky to not be in the path of any potential floods, slides, etc. But fires have been much worse - in direct relation to how little snowpack we get",0,,,18,farming
1b62lbt,0,"We’re currently experiencing:

Best yields ever year after year (corn/soy) due to less rain.  We have flat, black ground that’s poorly drained.

More hail events.  Not sure if this is climate change, but it’s more frequent the past ~10 years.

Wind damage events are nearly every year somewhere in our county.  Beans typically recover, corn gets goosenecked if it happens in late spring/early summer.  

I’ve seen 3 derechos within 30 miles of where I live since 2015.  Had only seen one in my lifetime before that.  Lots of machine sheds and bins are getting replaced as a result when it happens.

Property/acreage insurance has doubled in a single year under our previous carrier.  We switched and found cheaper but I’m sure that won’t last. 

As far as the actual temperatures, summers seem to be cooler than I remember them being growing up.  Winters are just as cold, with the exception of this winter.  With the exception of a couple of weeks of very cold, this winter has pretty much been like an extended fall.  We had guys putting on NH3 two weeks ago, never seen that in mid February, not even close.

So I don’t know if we were in a relatively stable period for the majority of the 1900’s and this is just Mother Nature doing what it can do, or maybe the climate actually is “changing”.  Either way, it is what it is, the average person can’t do shit about any of it.

I've thought the same then I realized it's because we went from 80-85 degrees and 80-99% humidity to 90-95 degrees and like 50-60% humidity. After I went to California to work in 100+ degrees and 30% or lower humidity I realized just how much humidity made it feel hotter.

Huge portions of the Netherlands are reclaimed from the sea. Very few forests remain. The entire east coast of the US used to be forested. Southern California was mostly inhospitable, but we farm there with the support of irrigation. Each year more of the amazon is cut down for farming.

We are having a warmer winter this year after having a very cold one last year. This is pretty much exactly what we had 13 and 14 years ago respectively.  So is it climate change or just the way the weather cycles?

I remember about 20 years ago the largest slough we had was dry enough to walk across. Have only seen that once despite being told we're in a very dry cycle right now. I believe it was the late 80's they had droughts around here and actually had a killing frost the first week of August in either 87 or 88.

We will adapt and continue to improve our practices. Even the IPCC report on climate change predicts a mere 3% reduction in GDP between now and 2100 due to climate change. 3% less rich over the next 76 years is basically a measurement error…",0,,,2,farming

1b62lbt,5,"Cattle are extremely resilient animals 

Higher co2, anecdotally, animals would have more supply of grass and grain to be fed and wouldn’t necessarily need or want any more food either.

I’m a row cropper—so like any city-folk marijuana tent grower, a CO2 increase to finish plants would be net positive on crops and net negative on the Earth—generally

I have a tiny cow-calf operation so definitely get your point

And a plant being a plant, it eats co2, and digests it amongst its’ growth: photosynthesis/biogenic cycle or whatever",0,,,2,farming

1b62lbt,0,"It’s constantly changing, but I think it’s part of the climate cycle. This year has been an odd year with the warm winter, but at the same time we had a similar winter on record in the 1880s. Not to mention the mass drought in the west in the 1930s. We’ve been due for this kind of year I think. 

Last year my hay field was too wet to cut half of what’s there. My buddy who I help out had amazing wheat yields, canola was a little iffy in places. There was worries that there would be a hay shortage but the last cuts were good here so it worked out fine. 

With the limited snow we got I am worried about drought this year, but at the same time I’ve always had standing water in my field so it might actually dry up some. We have gotten two dumps of snow totalling about a foot and a half in the last 2 weeks so there might be some initial moisture. I guess we will see what we get for spring rains.",0,,,-3,farming

Downvoting for this part. The big departure from historical norms we are seeing is man-made.",0,,,7,farming
1b62lbt,2,"As I said though, we had a winter here in my region that was hotter and had less snow in 1886. That was before industrialization, before automobiles, before the region was all that well settled or developed. We wouldn’t even have a railroad in this region for another 2 years. If you can explain to me how this was caused by human causes I’m all ears.",0,,,-1,farming

1b62lbt,0,Not sure how it affects production as drought is cyclical and ive been through a few of them. All I know is we have added solar panels to our farms and drive electric trucks. Converted our shops to heat pumps and are now saving a fortune on energy costs. So there's that.,0,,,1,farming
