4451rm,0,Can you explain risk-based vs hazard-based regulatory policy for GMOs? Which one is better in your opinion and why?,0,,,13,science
4451rm,1,"A hazard is something that could cause harm. Any specific hazard could be relatively mild (like a paper cut to your finger) or severe (like for instance an explosive volcano eruption). To consider the risk to any individual of these things causing harm, we must also consider the ‘exposure’ ie. how often do you handle paper in a way it could cut you or how frequently does any specific volcano erupt and how much time do you spend close by etc. Most people would accept the risks of both these scenarios. In one, the exposure to paper-handling is high but the hazard is low. In the other, although the hazard is extremely severe, the chances of it happening are low so we accept risks of the occasional visit to an active caldera. 
Any sensible regulatory policy must be based on a transparent and logical analysis of the risk which takes into account both the hazard and the exposure. Any regulatory oversight of biotechnology based purely on hazard removes the power of the individual to choose. All aspects of life are based on balancing risks and benefits and I prefer to keep that power in the hands of the consumer. This also means that there should be complete transparency with regards to labelling etc.

I will try to find more, but in essence, as any big business enterprise is focused on, it's about making money and not saving the world. I struggle with the idea that Monsanto provides GM seeds to developing and underdeveloped countries, where seed saving is illegal under their patent and most of their seeds only produce once. That causes a level of dependence and therefore a continuous market in food insecurity, doesn't it?

I also struggle with the fact that they do not, by law, have to publish their findings. The fact that it is not explained anywhere on their website simply adds to this mystery. As a consumer, I want to see their plans, their actions, and their safety nets. 

As I said, I do not have a problem with genetic modification as a science. Humans have been doing that for as long as agriculture has been a thing. I get that. I struggle with one entity holding the cards. I struggle with their legal practices. I struggle with their lack of transparency.

Seed saving is almost never practiced in the modern world, GMO or not, because most seeds are hybrids which don't produce stable offspring. Farmers willfully sign contracts preventing seed saving the same way you agree to not burn a CD when you buy it.

>I also struggle with the fact that they do not, by law, have to publish their findings

Why should they be forced to release private data? Importantly, though, Monsanto allows researchers anywhere to study their products and publish results without requiring approval.

>Moran, Shannon (2014) ""Agricultural Patenting: A Case Study of Monsanto,"" Pepperdine Policy Review: Vol. 7, Article 4. Available at: http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/ppr/vol7/iss1/4

Patenting plants has existed LONG before Monsanto.  Specifically, in the US it was officially law in the 1930 Plant Patent act.  Monsanto isn't even the largest company in the seed business, there certainly is no monopoly in the seed business  Lastly, it is anti-GMO activists that have erected such restrictions that only large companies can participate in this market.

This has nothing to do with ethics or dishonesty.

>Ethics and the Business of Bioscience By Margaret L. Eaton, Chapter 3. Ethics Analysis Applied to Monsanto and the labeling of rbST

Yes this is a title of a paper.  What was the outcome?  Was it ethical or not?  The court certainly thought that labeling was neither legal or necessary, that is why they struck down mandatory rBST labeling.  PS, this isn't even a Monsanto product.

This has nothing to do with ethics or dishonesty.

>Effects of field-realistic doses of glyphosate on honeybee appetitive behaviour. Herbert LT, Vázquez DE, Arenas A, Farina WM. J Exp Biol. 2014 Oct 1;217(Pt 19):3457-64. doi: 10.1242/jeb.109520. Epub 2014 Jul 25.

Again, this has nothing to do with ethics or dishonesty.  

Honeybees do not typically pollinate nor are associated with GM crops that use glyphosate so the premise of the study is deeply flawed.  The fact is that honeybees don't have the receptor by which glyphosate works on plants.  I guess you didn't actually read this paper either because they didn't find any hard facts either way.

>Monsanto provides GM seeds to developing and underdeveloped countries, where seed saving is illegal under their patent and most of their seeds only produce once. 

False, the vast majority of seeds to developing countries are free of this restriction.  However, it is nearly irrelevant since seed saving, even in poor countries is not effective since hybrids don't breed true.

This example isn't even an issue with Monsanto because it is a false claim, where the exact opposite in the case.


>I also struggle with the fact that they do not, by law, have to publish their findings. 

Where do you get this crazy idea?  GM seeds have been studied and developed by 1000s of universities.  Every company has to present huge amounts of research to public agencies get GM seeds approved.  There is a HUGE amount of oversight and it takes years to get a new varietal approved.

Of course it is possible to alter the nutritional balance of a crop by all other forms of plant breeding. It is actually less likely when using genetic modification because there is an understanding of the changes that a specific alteration will cause. There is a pre-market authorization step for GMOs, so changes to nutritional composition of the new crop are analyzed.

4451rm,1,">Now with some GMOs plants are being grown with other species DNA mixed in (for example I know of a study using frog DNA in tomatoes to make the skin tougher so they can be machine picked) do you think these type of GMOs plants are worse then what **Mandela** did or even the Golden Rice Project?

FYI [Gregor Mendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) was the father of genetics

[Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) was a civil rights leader

edit: Regarding your question that Dr. Jones didn't mention, BT crops and roundup ready crops incorporate genes from other species which people find scary because humans are doing it. Gene transfer between species happens in nature and may be more common than we think. We're just doing it in ways that hurt pests and benefits us. It's called horizontal gene transfer and it goes all the way back to why we have mitochondria.

4451rm,2,"Let me counter with another argument. If we take plants that are locally adapted for a region, and then load them up with a selected set of genes that are useful (say, maybe some root architecture genes that protect against drought, some insecticides, etc) and then distribute them back into the region, would this not solve transport and wastage issues?

Breeding traditionally is long, slow, and expensive. GM is faster, but only works if you know what you're putting in and the trait is qualitative. If we could slot in useful traits into locally adapted germplasm, we'd be able to have regions of the world that are self-sufficient, rather than importing food from somewhere else.",0,,,2,science
4451rm,3,"It was a question, not an argument. But if I *were* to make an argument, it might be that our immediate and future food problems aren't with plant breeding of any type, they are with agricultural and commodity systems (i.e., economic). The debate over GMOs seems primarily, to me, to be taking attention away from deeper, systemic issues with our food systems. Nothing wrong with GM to me in principle, but I'm not part of the ""GM will save the world"" orthodoxy. Why? Because our (currently most-pressing) problems with food have very little to do with plant breeding.",0,,,1,science
4451rm,4,"It vaguely irritates me when the ""Feed the world"" line is used too, to be honest. Agriculture is devalued in western society because we haven't had famine in quite some time. The cost of food production is currently externalized, and we are going to run into trouble soon. It's not a matter of feeding the world at this point, but moreso ""How do we manage to stop making large withdrawals from the environmental stability bank while still making agriculture affordable to the farmer?""

I do disagree, and maybe it's just the job talking, but plant breeding is a big part of a solution to a more looming problem of sustainability. I do agree with you about the economics, though, but am focused on another problem.",0,,,1,science
4451rm,5,"> plant breeding is a big part

We don't disagree at all! Plant breeding (of all types) is a *part* of the solutions we need. My own work has taken me into the field of systems ecology when it comes to plants, and it pains me a bit when we ignore other aspects of our problems with agriculture for the sake of future technological 'solutions.' It's kind of like climate change. Do we make tough choices now, or do we bank on someone inventing carbon sequestration technology to save us later?

Let's do *both*. :) Cheers.",0,,,1,science

The European Food Safety Authority is an independent scientific body tasked by the EC to conduct an analysis of GMO applications for import or for cultivation in EU. Only the tiny proportion of crop types that fall into the definition of a GMO require this type of authorization. The GMO panel of EFSA uses a comparative approach and considers three main areas; a molecular characterization of the inserted DNA and the resulting ‘event’, an analysis of the food and feed implications of the genetic change and a critical appraisal of the environmental risks. After considering all the available data, the GMO panel produces an opinion on whether the GM plant is equivalent to its non-GM counterpart.",0,,,2,science

In academia there are a great number of GMOs created, but many are of no commercial benefit and help boost fundamental understanding instead. If they were to become more socially acceptable, where do you see GMO varieties coming from, as many commercial breeders seem to have stayed away from the technology? Or do you think there could be a reduced role for traditional breeders in the future?

Also, everyone has their own ideas of what future GM crops may look like. If GM were to become more common, would we see an avalanche of new beneficial traits that couldn't be achieved previously?
