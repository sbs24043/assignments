I live in a huge farming belt that makes almost all water unswimmable for a month every summer. Hundreds (thousands?) of people, animals, dogs get sick every year.

I don’t know what soil stockpiling is or why a farmer would “handle” soil. Do you mean manure?

How can you tell half of these things driving by? You can eye ball the fert rate  or how much pesticides are being applied from your car? 

You probably would find improper practices on most farms. Reality is most farms cut corners because farmers are price takers. There’s no way to increase margin if costs go up, farmers are at the mercy of the market which they do not set. I do not think farms should necessarily be exempt from regulation, but the more is added without a way of offsetting it with added revenue will lead to more consolidation, as smaller farms are unable to acquire capital to comply.",0,,,2,canada

Then they make an argument saying policy x is actually policy y, which it isn't. 

It would at least make sense if people brought forward examples and stated their concern that the government may expand policy x into y, but just lying about what they are doing is disingenuous and not productive.

What we have essentially done is enrich the Earth with nitrogen in such a manner that much of it is locked up in billions of large animals like humans and cows by way of investing it selectively to the food they eat.

And the restrictions have gotten tighter and tighter ever since. Yet, european farms are still competetive.

With lower fertilizer usage does not only come lower yield, it also brings lower production cost, and i am guessing here, most farmers pay $2 in ‘extra’ fertilizer to get $1 in extra yield.

They simply could not afford it.  From the same article

>The agrochemical ban caused rice production to drop 20 percent in the six months after it was implemented, causing a country that had been self-sufficient in rice production to spend $450 million on rice imports — much more than the $400 million that would’ve been saved by banning fertilizer imports.

>To a large extent, the required technologies and practices already exist. It is now a question of how to increase their use, identify and address any challenges or shortcomings, and ensure that farmers have the knowledge and support required to do so. 

Further on

>The Government of Canada has been clear that the objective of the national target for fertilizers is to reduce emissions, and that the primary method to achieve this is not to establish a mandatory reduction in fertilizer use that isn’t linked to improved efficiency and maintaining or improving yields. Rather, the goal is to maximize efficiency, optimize fertilizer use, encourage innovation, and to work collaboratively with the agriculture sector, partners and stakeholders in identifying opportunities that will allow us to successfully reach this target.

They provide some details

>During the first phase of consultations, stakeholders identified a number of opportunities to improve nutrient management and reduce emissions associated with fertilizer application. These can broadly be categorized as those related to the principles of Fertilizer Canada’s 4R Nutrient Stewardship and related BMPs, and those that do not fall under the 4R approach. Given its prominence in the sector, 4R is discussed separately here although there are potential areas of overlap.  
>  
>The 4R Nutrient Stewardship approach, developed by Fertilizer Canada, was raised by a large number of stakeholders during the first phase of consultations as a pathway for achieving emissions reductions. This approach is designed to promote sustainable use of fertilizer in crop production and can reduce GHG emissions by focusing on the “4 Rs” of fertilizer application:  
  
Right source matches the fertilizer type to crop needs. This encompasses the use of synthetic versus organic fertilizers, as well as fertilizers with different nutrient compositions and different formats (liquid, granular, seed-banded, slow release, manure etc.) and products that include additives such as nitrification and urease inhibitors;  
>  
>  
Right rate matches the amount of fertilizer to crop needs. This entails only applying what can be taken up by the crop over the course of the growing season. This recommendation can include precision application technologies (including those that address in-field variability), and the use of soil tests to make nutrient management decisions accounting for existing soil nutrient levels;  
>  
>  
Right time means nutrients are available when crops need them. This could include practices such as split application (applying at seeding as well as later at critical crop growth stages) or avoiding applying fertilizer in the fall when there is a higher risk of loss through spring runoff; and,  
>  
>  
Right place means nutrients are placed where crops can use them. This recommendation includes practices such as banding whereby the fertilizer is applied in concentrated strips; side dressing whereby fertilizers are placed in a row adjacent to the crop, or seed-placed, where fertilizers are placed in the same furrow as the seed. This includes practices such as broadcasting where possible, whereby nutrients are spread on the surface of the soil (or growing crop) and which can lead to inefficiencies and losses to the broader environment.  
>  
>There is widespread recognition that the principles underlying the 4R practices can reduce emissions from N fertilizer. Existing data from Fertilizer Canada and the 4R Research Network indicate that the implementation of a 4R program can reduce fertilizer-related emissions while maintaining and/or improving crop yields, with suggestions that the widespread adoption of 4R in Western Canada could reduce emissions by 2 to 3 megatonnes – or 50 to 75% of the Government’s emission reduction target.",0,,,1,canada

3) This is only a big deal because it cuts into aggro-business corporate profits. 

4) For small farmers, this a win, since a lot of them care about their land and the ecosystem, which causes them to be less competitive against large businesses that don't. This is a boon for small-scale, local farming and farmers, the only type of farming that can truly be done sustainably.
