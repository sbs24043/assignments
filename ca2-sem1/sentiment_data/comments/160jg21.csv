160jg21,0,I’ll say it again there should be a 100 acre plot minimum for a record.,0,,,80,farming
160jg21,1,"
There should certainly be some minimum. I can garden the shit out of 10 ft of soybeans.",0,,,19,farming
160jg21,2,It's ten acres I think.,0,,,2,farming
160jg21,3,Other commenters are saying 2.5,0,,,2,farming
160jg21,1,"That’d surely make things more sporting. 

The law of diminishing returns doesn’t apply to 2.5 acres. If it was 100 acres, economic factors start to set in.",0,,,18,farming
160jg21,2,"Economic factors should be considered anyway. 

variable inputs should be noted and transparent for the competition.",0,,,3,farming
160jg21,1,At least two categories one for maybe a minimum of 2 acres or something a little smaller and another for a minimum 100 acres,0,,,5,farming
160jg21,1,He did it on 2.5 acres. Is that not proof enough that 200 bushel soybeans is possible on an acre of ground?,0,,,7,farming
160jg21,2,That’s ridiculous. What’s stopping someone from just picking out a 2 acre section in a perfect low spot? You probably could do it on dryland,0,,,13,farming
160jg21,3,Yea isn’t that the point of records it’s a show of the absolute maximum achievable.,0,,,9,farming
160jg21,3,"Yeah that's the point it has to be perfect. Nobody said it was a field average. Just that it is possible. He figures the whole yield will run between 140 and 160.

Why is it ridiculous to prove something? A yield per acre is a yield per acre.",0,,,7,farming
160jg21,4,140 bu is not too shabby.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,1,"I'd also argue that irrigation should not be part of it as well.  I agree with you, 100 acres minimum and no irrigation.  The point of argument then lies in how much fertilization and weed control is acceptable.",0,,,4,farming
160jg21,2,That makes no sense at all. Then it just comes down to who gets the luckiest.,0,,,17,farming
160jg21,2,"In georgia, no irrigation means no crop",0,,,18,farming
160jg21,3,"Good then they will be on the same level with the rest of us in Indiana, Illinois and Iowa.",0,,,11,farming
160jg21,4,I don't think nobody wants to deal with all those insurance claims.,0,,,5,farming
160jg21,4,We irrigate in Central Wisconsin tho… why don’t you just put some pivots in?? We get nothing in are sandy soil with out them. 250 to 280 bushels yield aren’t even that crazy with irrigation.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,5,"We don't have sandy soil for one, 2 at $10 grand plus a well it's not likely to happen.

Climate change coming though, who knows if we will be able to farm in 10 to 20 years.",0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,So rainfall in your area is the deciding factor?,0,,,3,farming
160jg21,3,Not near as much irrigation out there as you think.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,How very localist of you. Must be nice to not have to irrigate all summer long.,0,,,7,farming
160jg21,3,"The thing is, you aren’t set up to irrigate at all in these places, and some years you get fucked. We almost did here this year with crops looking like no harvest, and then suddenly the skies opened up, thank fuck.",0,,,3,farming
160jg21,2,id say there should just be more categories,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,Why don't you form your own organization and run your own contest. That way you can make up whatever rules make you happy.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,This sounds dumb af,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,nah.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,1,Be tough on those of us who don't have a 100 acre field.  All of us don't farm in the I states.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,0,I wonder how much nitrogen he applied.,0,,,9,farming
160jg21,0,"Love to see these. Would also love to see the breakdown of cost, number of application, etc. but the fact that 200 bushel soybeans is possible is wild.",0,,,8,farming
160jg21,0,The world record pumpkin is over a ton. It’s possible to do crazy shit on a small plot. (I think they use like a half acre for one pumpkin plant when they try for a record.),0,,,5,farming
160jg21,0,"i second the 100 acre minimum for a yield contest.  Literally it's like looking for love in a brothel for a farmer to look at a yield contest for ways to improve his growing skills.  A yield contest is not to help other farmers farm better,  A yield contest serves as a megaphone for a marketing department",0,,,13,farming
160jg21,1,"But the point of these is to find what’s possible, obviously this isn’t going to be applied in a production environment, what can be taken away from it that can be?",0,,,6,farming
160jg21,2,"What gets taken away is about $785 per acre of soybeans raised in the USA.  Obviously if you spend  more than $785/ac your yields may increase.  For decades American farmers have increased the national yield average across every acre in America.   It is a well known tactic for businesses vying for a share of that $785/ac to act as if they alone have the new exciting breakthrough every farmer should rush out and buy.  They'll hold up a yield contest winner as evidence of their product's worth and all that is just a ""snake oil salesman"" at work.",0,,,2,farming
160jg21,3,I think you just described every sporting event that has equipment manufacturers as sponsors.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,1,Lots of fields in the south east aren't 100 acres lol,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,0,"It's pretty early for soybean harvest in the USA, ain't it?  Is this last year?",0,,,3,farming
160jg21,1,He is in Georgia that might as well be in another country compared to most grain states.,0,,,29,farming
160jg21,2,We usually start the second week in September here in Iowa.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,1,People started cutting beans here in Mississippi first of august,0,,,2,farming
160jg21,0,I bet the stalks are massive. Definitely don't want to cut at a 90° .,0,,,3,farming
160jg21,0,Anyone good at the conversion to T/Ha?,0,,,3,farming
160jg21,1,6.2 tons per ha,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,2,"More like 13.8t/ha

If 6.2 is 200 i raise 400bu corn average",0,,,2,farming
160jg21,3,Evidently I'm not good at conversions after all lol,0,,,3,farming
160jg21,0,"The real winner here is Randy Dowdy, collecting all that money from these people to be in his exclusive club, along with the kickbacks from these companies he's endorsing. Theres a bunch of these guys in my area paying 5000 a year to be in this super secret club.I want to see them do this on non irrigated ground in the midwest on more than 10 acres. The input costs would be insane for all these products",0,,,3,farming
160jg21,0,Irrigation in Georgia?  I’m not a farmer and I don’t know much about soybeans but I assume georgia doesn’t typically require irrigation. Is the winner just irrigating to ensure success?,0,,,2,farming
160jg21,1,I'm in Minnesota but irrigating here is very much not ensuring success in soybeans.,0,,,3,farming
160jg21,1,[deleted],0,,,4,farming
160jg21,2,Here in Ga we use overhead pivots. Usually circle pivots. Water is pumped from wells or out of ponds.,0,,,4,farming
160jg21,1,You definitely got to have irrigation in my county. You get lucky sometimes though,0,,,2,farming
160jg21,2,How much natural rain fall do you guys get? Are there dry spells during the summer?,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,3,"We average around 55 inches per year. But, it's not normally when we need it. We are fortunate to have the irrigations.  Because we normally have to run them to get our peanuts out of the ground.",0,,,2,farming
160jg21,0,2022.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,0,"I’d love to see some dry land records. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to have the ability to irrigate to see numbers like this. I love seeing triple digits in the low ground on a good year dry land, though.",0,,,1,farming
160jg21,0,Wow Americans sure love tofu.,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,1,It's probably for cow feed,0,,,1,farming
160jg21,0,Can anyone convert this to t/ha for me?,0,,,0,farming
160jg21,1,[Sharpshooter999 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/160jg21/comment/jxnetyb/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3) says 6.2 tons per ha,0,,,1,farming
