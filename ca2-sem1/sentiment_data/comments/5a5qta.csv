Furthermore, growing conditions in both continents never received a single mention; GxE is *the* buzzword in plant breeding right now and the biggest factor in ""E"" is climate.

I get that there are potential benefits in a lot of situations especially in developing countries, but if we are seeing problems with super weeds, a lack of biodiversity, poisons in our food supply, and not necessarily a rise in yield, it's something we need to strongly consider (and allow for consumers to make the decisions themselves).

20 years ago, producers in NE, where I'm most familiar with corn production, were growing 75-100 bushel per acre corn and many people grew milo because it was cheaper and yielded about the same return to acre. 

This year, I had many producers who were disappointed in their 200 bushel per acre corn. 

These guys will tell you, the only reason they grow better yielding crops now is because of drought tolerant varieties. 

Someone will probably point out that bushels is a measure of volume, not weight, but if you throw in test weight, it hasn't changed. Still between 56-61 lbs per bushel. 

Additionally, the USDA crop production reports have said twice now in their estimate that this year will be the biggest production level in US history for corn. (Don't get me started on USDA crop reports, but it bears mentioning) 

It has happened in wheat varieties, soybean varieties, and corn varieties. These new breeds produce so much, that we are currently in a supply glut on corn and wheat. There's literally more in storage than the world is demanding. ",0,,,7,science

Dynap, Lasso, Prowl, Treflan, and others darn near disappeared overnight. When glyphosate appeared on the market it was extremely effective in all weather conditions, safe to spray/handle, and stable enough that any farmer could spray it without drift worries.  

The adoption of no-till that became possible thanks to effective herbicides has conserved an unfathomable amount of topsoil. No more moldboard plowing, full tillage, row cultivating all summer, etc.

With BT stacked corn, granular insecticide use has disappeared. Before the 1980's there wasn't a corn planter sold in the U.S. without insecticide boxes. Now most manufacturers don't even have them as an option.  

Yes, non-GMO soybeans will yield right with a modern GMO number. Many farmers, me included, are going back to public varieties because they are cheaper and can be retained for seed.

Most interesting thing to me is that according to a study in Nature, farmers growing non-BT corn actually benefitted more (dollar wise) than the farmers using it. The natural corn borer population has been suppressed so much that they aren't a huge threat in most areas. Think herd immunity. Problem is they will come back with a vengeance if everyone decided to save money and plant non-traited corn.
