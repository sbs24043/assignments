195z2xo,0,"good idea! i did this when i was in college as a class assignment. what we did was pick three factors then reclassify each raster to be on the same scale range then ran it through a suitability tool. there is actually a training on this in esri trainings, you do need a licensed account though but you can probably get one through your school",0,,,1,ArcGIS
195z2xo,1,"interesting! could you elaborate on what you mean by reclassifying to the same scale range? i have a licensed account through my university, i will look up the trainings, do you know what itâ€™s called?",0,,,1,ArcGIS
195z2xo,2,"rasters have cells that contain values. A very brief description would be you have a raster and some cell values of the raster are 2 = fields 3 = tree coverage 4 = water 5 = desert you would want to use the reclassify tool to set this to your ""suitable"" scale so you will tell the tool 2 = 1, 3 = 2, 4 = 4, 5 = 3. now you will have a scale 1-4 on how suitable your land is (1 being the most suitable and 4 being least). you will do this for each raster AND make sure use use the same scale for each. then run a suitablity tool to find the spot you want.

195z2xo,3,"i see, and what basis would i assign the new values with? i understand i can reclassify a land use to a value on a scale, but im not sure i understand what makes something 1 vs 2. is it just by preference? as in i want less developed land therefore i would rank wetlands lower (ie: 1) and cities higher (ie: 4)?",0,,,1,ArcGIS
