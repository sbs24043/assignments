7s5ueb,1,"Agreed, common knowledge, but easier said than done!",0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,2,"I'm in a perfect zone for covercrops and, over a period of five years, I have yet to see a net [financial] gain from using them. This doesn't mean I plan on not using them: the ""intangibles"" of reduced surface erosion and compaction mitigation are enough for me to be sold on the benefit of having roots (living or dead) for most of the year.",0,,,8,farming
7s5ueb,3,What cover crops are you using? Are you using the same or rotating?,0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,4,"Grasses (be it oats, annual rye or cereal rye), legumes (assorted clovers like crimson, alsike, berseem and yellow sweet), brassicas (radish and turnips, although these are fast getting pushed out of all my mixes) and non-legume broadleaves like buckwheat and sunflower. I'm interseeding into both corn and soys; and double/single cut red clover blend goes into my winter wheat (this is the only one that truly pays dividends in my opinion).

I have 30 acre fields where, the covers are all winter kill (vs some no-cover check strips), other 30 acre fields where it's all winter-survival and then one 50 acre field where it's a mixture of both.",0,,,4,farming
7s5ueb,5,What soil type? And is it very fertile?,0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,6,"Sandy Loams to Clay Loams, and yields have a broad range; some are great, some are very consistently average for the area.",0,,,2,farming
7s5ueb,7,Do you use livestock to graze the cover crops or is it just for the next years crop? ,0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,8,"No livestock within 75km (outside of the few horse farms and a couple extremely small family herds, read: 5-10 head). ",0,,,2,farming
7s5ueb,9,"Ic, I'm in livestock country but am going to try cover crop on my dryland wheat ground.  I'm not sure that it will help my following years wheat yield. If it does, that's great, but I will be surprised.  Where I think it will really help is by getting a little extra fall and winter grazing.  Overall I'm expecting it to increase my bottom line but that's just from utilizing the grazing.  ",0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,7,Interesting especially since cover crops usually are best for clayish soils ,0,,,1,farming
7s5ueb,0,If there is enough rain yes,0,,,4,farming
7s5ueb,1,"preach on brother. Glad to see someone other than me beating the gong of ""cover crops actually use water"". Its not a relevant issue for a lot of farmers, but then theres the rest of us....",0,,,3,farming
7s5ueb,0,"I like cover crops for controlling erosion but, I also like them because they break the disease cycle. I plant the same thing every year, so when I cover crop I’m keeping the soil active with something besides strawberries. ",0,,,2,farming
7s5ueb,0,I’m working on a no till cover crop pilot program at the moment in New England. ,0,,,1,farming
