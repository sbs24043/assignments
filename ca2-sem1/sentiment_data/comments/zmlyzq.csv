zmlyzq,0,"Ooo! I actually did a research report on this for my English class this semester. So I can answer it.

As to why increased carbon dioxide can cause harm to plants and crops; It is true that increased carbon dioxide can increase crop yield, but they also become less nutrient dense. Crops today are 10-20% bigger, because of CO2, than they were in 1980 but on average [5-15% less nutrient dense](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00924/full). Which isn’t too bad. Carbon dioxide is actually mostly good for plants. 

But there are a few factors that can harm crop growth caused by climate change that cancel out the gains from CO2. Crops and plants begin experiencing heat stress at temperatures above [30-35C (86-95F)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7795586/). And each degree above that limit results in a 7% decrease in crop yield.

And precipitation and temperature patterns are largely changing throughout the world. Droughts become longer and more intense (see Colorado river, Mississippi River, the Yangtze River and the agricultural impact to surrounding areas) and some areas will see larger increases in flooding as well, delaying seed planting in the spring, like what happened in 2018. [Only 29%](https://ussoy.org/recapping-the-2019-u-s-soybean-crop-results/) of soybean crops were able to be planted at a optimal time that year because of flooding. 

So really, carbon dioxide is only just a small piece to the puzzle

Here's your pro in context of a pro's and con's list:

Pro's: 

- Plants will grow faster with more CO2

- Crops will be larger and sweeter

- Farming will become more productive at higher latitudes, particularly North America

- The variety of crops that can be grown in a few lucky places will increase


Con's:

- Extreme droughts and heatwaves are affecting yields already

- New weeds, pests and diseases will invade cold parts of the world as they warm up

- Weeds will grow larger and faster too

- Fighting those with weedkillers, pesticides, fungicides, etc. will fuck up the natural ecosystem even further

- Increased need for water to irrigate crops means less available for everyone else, including industries

- Reduced nutrients in crops will increase malnutrition, specially in parts of the world already malnourished

- Some parts of the world will get too dry to farm

- Some will get too hot for humans to work the farms

- Some will ""only"" lose the ability to grow certain crops, which will reduce the variety of people's diets - malnutrition again

- Harvested crops will spoil faster, more will be lost in transit

- Global food prices will rise due to scarcity

zmlyzq,1,"There is so much more to it than this. I've taken a passing interest in soil ecology. I'm no expert, and I hardly even know how to explain it, but I'll give it a shot.

The world most likely had ~50÷ more trees than we currently do, as humanity has been engaged in deforestation for thousands of years. Forests and plants not only use photosynthesis to create oxygen and glucose, they also filter dirty water, retain water in the soil, and have mechanisms to regulate their environment's temperaturen (even in the scorching sun and freezing winter cold). Plants are also vital in preventing soil erosion and ensuring healthy soil. Forests play an important role in regulating local temperature and in preventing desertification.

Some plants and trees can have roots reaching down as far as 100 meters below surface, though this varies from plant to plant. In the soil exists fungi networks, bacteria, worms, and many other creatures. All of these exist in a mutual beneficial ecosystem. The bacteria and fungi dissolve rocks to access mineral resources. The fungi trades these minerals with the plants in exchange for glucose, and all the plant needs to do is ask the fungi for what it needs. ""Good"" bacteria help protect the roots of the plants from ""bad"" bacteria, in what I assume is a similar trade of resources. The worms eat soil and bacteria, pooping out resources in a form bio-available to plants, as well as providing pathways for oxygen and water to exist in the soil. This allows the soil to store water for when the plants, as well as other creatures, needs it, something which is required for the survival of the entire ecosystem.

The bacteria, fungi, and earthworm all play a vital role in waste disposal, breaking down biological waste material at surface level and turning it into bio-available nutrition. They turn dead plants and animals into soil.

This entire ecosystem is fragile. If it becomes anaerobic (no oxygen) the ""good"" bacteria and fungi die. The earthworm is required to keep the soil aerobic. With modern heavy machinery,  such as farming equipment for tilling the earth, harvesting, or applying pesticides, the soil is compacted. This compaction prevents the roots of plants from penetrating deep enough into the ground to reach their nutrition. The ecosystem living in the soil gets crushed, and the soil goes anaerobic. The anaerobic soil is much preferable to the ""bad"" bacteria that harm plants. The pesticides kill the friendly bacteria, the fungi, and the earthworm. The soil loses its ability to filtrate and store water, meaning rainfall and floods can't be absorbed. The water that cannot be absorbed by the soil runs off into rivers before reaching the ocean, where it exits the local water cycle, making droughts occur more often and be more severe. In the end, the entire ecosystem is completely destroyed, leading to unhealthy and diseased plants with nutritional deficiencies they pass on to us.

There is obviously much more that could be said on this topic. The key points here are related to how modern agriculture is unsustainable, harmful to the soil itself, and harmful to the ecosystem. Human infrastructure expansion is equally as bad in many ways, as we have removed nature's method of handling floods, droughts, heat waves, cold snaps, resource distribution between plants through the fungi networks, and many other parts of the ecosystem that made earth habitable.",0,,,16,conspiracy

The soil stores massive amounts of carbon! Our deforestation and infrastructure projects, as well as industrial agriculture, has released a lot of this carbon from the soil ecosystem. If we fix it, we can put carbon back into the soil!

This moisture returns as rainwater that healthy soil is able to absorb. Nature maintains a healthy water cycle, and we have disturbed it in countless ways.

But the best corn I ever had was 20 years ago and I was living in Canada on a small hobby farm and our neighbors grew the best corn I’ve ever had.

This is all to say that, I might be lying by omission by not saying that there could be other reasons plants are bigger than they were?

I want to add, I’m not posing that question as a debate, or “end” to a debate. I have an open mind toward either direction (skeptical, but open). My bigger, overarching question is, if some people don’t factor this in (if that’s incorrect, I apologize), then how can we get an accurate picture Overall?

I want to reiterate, I’m just posting this to get your response. In the last 2 links I provided, u fully expect there to be some (key word “some”, not all) embellished material. But the rest of the sources seem pretty solid, and it’s a fact that they’ve had the ability to modify the weather for 70+ years at least. 

We all see the streaks in the sky, and I think it’s important to factor that in as well (even though it’s hard to find any transparent, concrete information on what is being sprayed out). Since it’s so hard to prove/disprove, I’m not pushing on that too hard. It’s just mighty strange. 

I took a picture on Xmas eve, 2 years ago. Total coincidence (I took the picture for my job). It was in the beginning of what would become a 12 inch snow storm, and in that picture (100% by chance), I saw 7 airplanes, all parallel, all with several miles long streaks that stayed in the sky. It seemed very hard to find an explanation for that, and I still struggle with it. 

Some people will say “duh, it’s exhaust fumes”. I don’t think it is, because not all planes have it, and I’ve seen exhaust fumes from some. They dissipate quickly. And regardless of the temperature, the ones I’m speaking to do not, and they’re always in a pattern",0,,,1,conspiracy

zmlyzq,5,"So, in theory, we know that too many heavy gasses in an environment will make that environment hotter. Just, generally. We can rig up a glass tank with lab equipment and make the temperatures in the tank hotter based on what gases we put into it.

We can look at Venus, which has a lot of gasses, and is very hot. We can also look at Mars, which has very little gas, and is much colder. So we know that gasses make an environment - a fish tank, a room, a building, a planet - hotter. They trap the heat that comes in from the sun. This is the greenhouse effect. In theory, I think we can all agree that this is a real phenomenon. We know what types of gases can do this.

And we are pumping out massive amounts of these gases, in quantities and at a scale that simply didn’t exist 200 years ago. We can burn a kilogram of coal or a liter of oil in a lab and measure exactly what sort of gases it produces. And we know (roughly) how much coal and oil we burn.

And so, the question is, is climate change mostly (or entirely) man made? We have two competing theories - one, that the earth is doing a natural temperature cycle and our actions do not affect it, or two, our actions are causing the effect.

Option one involves two major coincidences: one, that our human made gas emissions do not have the effect on the earth’s environment that the same gases have on other planets, or in a lab setting, *and* that the timing of the earth’s natural cycle just so happens to line up with our increased gas emissions, by coincidence. That’s two big leaps of logic that, to me, don’t make sense.

Option two involves no leaps of logic. We know what these gases are, we know what effects they have, we know what produces them, and we know how much of that production we do. There’s no coincidence of timing; like a natural cycle syncing up. All that this theory requires is that things happen the way that observation and experimentation predicts that they will. If you burn fuel, you get carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide can cause a “blanket” or “greenhouse” effect which traps heat. Trapped heat means rising temperatures. Rising temperatures means climate change - extra energy in a system does all sorts of stuff. Melts ice. More rain. Longer droughts. Stronger storms. Observation and experimentation predict all of these things as a long term consequence of adding a considerable amount of carbon dioxide (and other combustion waste gases that have a similar effect) to the atmosphere.",0,,,2,conspiracy

Yes, A warmer earth is arguably better for humanity in the long term big picture because of increased ability to produce food. The only reason we can support 8 billion people is because we exist in an extremely warm and stable climate epoch, the Holocene, which began at the end of the last ice age.

There are reasons to fear a warmer earth though in the immediate term: 

- more energy in the atmosphere means more extreme weather, floods, hurricanes, storms, wildfires, and other disasters. Sea level rise and extinction of many other species are very real threats.

- the main fear is more energy in the atmosphere means more and bigger fluctuations. The reason the Holocene had been so good to us is that it’s STABLE above all else. If we throw that stability off, maybe temperatures will spike, then fall dramatically much more frequently.

zmlyzq,2,"You are discussing two different things. No scientists is saying that climate change is 100% bad for 100% of species. 

When the Chicxulub asteroid hit, 75% of plant and animal species on earth died. The species that were left filled the ecological niches that previously didn’t exist. 

CO2 does not create more productive plants necessarily. Plants need sunlight to be able to photosynthesize. If the CO2 forms a barrier preventing sunlight from getting to most plants, then plants were going to die. This is what happened in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Most plants died, like a large majority of them. This was caused by the carbon and dust in the air blocking solar rays. Plants also tend to chill in a fairly specific temp range. If the average temperature increases by a few degrees, plants can experience heat stress. This can kill off specifies and have massive impacts on the food chain. 

Also “give or take a few degrees” is an absolutely insane take to have. That’s a massive fucking difference. For example as temperatures are rising, Sea Turtles are approaching an extinction event because the sex of the eggs that they lay are determined by the temperature of the nest, with the difference being about 5 degrees. “Give or take a few degrees” is you admitting that an extinction event is occurring based off of climate change.",0,,,18,conspiracy

The only place this *isnt* true is the artic, but even that is debatable, as it appears that the *intensity* of the sun as it gets closer to the earth makes much more an impact on ice/sea levels than a couple of degrees difference. 

I have studied ""climate science"" extensively, as in from a highly respected university, and worked with/next too ""climate scientest."" I know what I'm talking about. There is no such thing as climate change. There is nothing that mankind can (currently) do that will have any *noticeable* impact on the climate of the world.

No one is saying that the world is going to end, they are saying a majority of life will die. Extinction events happen and have causes. One asteroid destroyed most life on earth. Temperature changes, increase in CO2, evolution, etc can all cause mass extinction events. In this case it’s looking like climate change is that mass extinction event. Some species will survive, absolutely, most won’t. Not all life on earth will end, but a lot of it will.

To the discussion at hand, it doesn't matter what happened after the chucxulub asteroid. Because an extention level event like that is an entirely different situation than what ""climate science"" says is the problem with CO2 today. An asteroid strike is going to do a whole lot more than just put some extra CO2 in the atmosphere. It's going to kick up fine particulate matter and darken the skies for years, if not decades. It's probably going to trigger volcanic activity and a host of other things. What I'm talking about is the idea that humans can produce enough CO2 in the modern era that it would have a noticeable impact on climate. And to that end, we can't. It's just not possible. The amount of CO2 we produce is tiny in comparison to natural events that release CO2. 

My point about mega fauna is meant to illustrate the main idea that more CO2= bigger, more productive plants= more O2 for humans to breathe. That a 10% increase in CO2 levels, if we could even get it that high, which I doubt would *quickly* be mitigated by bigger and more vigorous plant growth.  This happens in a very rapid time frame (weeks to months).  I don't need to be specific about which time period because my statement holds true regardless of the time period.

More CO2=/= Bigger Plants. Idk where you are getting that information from. More CO2 can mean more plants if they are able to get the sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. The problem is that more and larger plants degrade the soil of nutrients such as nitrogen. This is why in farming crop rotation is important. If there is just lots of plants the soil will lose nutrients, which means the plants have less nutritional value. If the plants have less nutritional value, less animals can be supported by those plants. That’s a massive disruption in the food chain and can lead to extinction events. Do you know when this happened? During the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs!

Things like the dust and metals and fine particulate matter that was suspended in the atmosphere for years/decades that covered the earth like a dusty smogy blanket. It was the triggering of a series of catastrophic volcanic activity, which pumps *actually* harmful gases like sulfer dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Which, again,  killed off plants, which cut off food for animals, while at the same time prevented the excess CO2 from being scrubed from the air. Again, I say, I'm not denying science.

So mankind couldn't... lets say geoengineer the planet by spraying aerosols into the atmosphere?

Im not saying we ARE/(aren't) doing it... but the physics and chemistry make sense and we very well could do it to raise/lower temperatures as we see fit.

We could also drill thermal boreholes and alter the climate of local regions as we see fit. 

We could also terraform large amounts of terrain, raising and lowering elevation/ making new rivers and dams, to alter our climate locally.

We could use nuclear/explosive devices (erroniously/for war/intentionally) to kick large amounts of dust into the atmosphere to drastivally change earths climate ( a bit off point but still technically mankind changing earths climate )

We could build a super large reflection disk at a lagrange point (and what a fun challenge that would be) and block a small amount of incoming sunlight, changing the earths climate.

If you look at it as just ""more co2 = more plants = more food = good"" it sounds great.. but in reality it wont go as you think it would, upsetting equilibriums that occur in a closed system (planet earth) can have a chain effect, lets factor in some more variables that can change just by changing the CO2 levels of the atmosphere:

Sure itll be greener... if you dont live near the equator.
Near the equator it will be a scorched desert due to the greenhouse effect.

If enough ice melts sea levels will rise and render some places that are habitable now inhabitable; this in turn will cause mass migrations and displacement around the world.

Canada and Russia will arise as the new superpowers just due to their new climate that will be mild compared to the rest of the world. The majority of the population worldwide will migrate north or south.

If the world population keeps growing at the rate it is by the time this happens we may have less total airable land than before and be unable to support our population, leading to mass famine, starvation, and death.

More CO2 in the atmosphere is absolutely a good thing. It allows plants to grow bigger, greener and become more productive. 

Bigger plants that are more productive means more Oxygen in the atmosphere. More oxygen in the air means people are 1) happier, 2) healthier. You ever have O2 therapy or go to an O2 bar? You know how great you feel after breathing air that has slightly more O2 in it? Now just imagine if plants were bigger and producing more O2 how much better we would *all* feel. 

The rabbit hole goes deeper than you think. They are intentionally trying to make CO2 to be a bad guy so we end up suffocating ourselves to death by our own hands and cries, and they are laughing at us the entire time while they sit in their O2 chambers and go to sleep with extra O2 at night.",0,,,-8,conspiracy

More CO2 = More plants = More O2

There can't be more O2 and CO2 simultaneously can there?  Especially with all the other shit we put in the air.

Besides I think the big worry for humans would be rising sea levels caused by rising temperatures wouldn't it?",0,,,4,conspiracy
zmlyzq,5,"Yes there can. 

70% + of our atmosphere is N2. The % of CO2 and O2 are significantly lower. If you increase the % of CO2 In the atmosphere that means plants can grow bigger (because you give them more to breathe) and then the bigger and more productive they are, the more oxygen they produce. More produced O2 means more available O2 for us to breathe. 

So as a whole, the entire composition of the atmosphere will change. So instead of having like 7% O2 and 12% CO2, you will have something like 15% O2 and 20% CO2. 

You can preform an experiment to test this. Get yourself two  self contained biomes, and put some plants in it. In your control group, pump in normal air. In your test group, pump in air with an increased level of CO2. Weekly/monthly/yearly test the % composition of the atmosphere. I will garentee you with 100 percent certainty that over a few months in your test biome that the O2 % in that biome will increase (I know this for a fact. This experiment has already been done, multiple times)

Edit to add. I will not comment on the rising sea levels because to do so I'd have to get deep into all the evidence that sea levels will not, and do not, rise due to human activity, and that the reasons why we have observed the seas rising is because we are ending a solar cycle and are at the end of an ice age.",0,,,-1,conspiracy
zmlyzq,6,"Interesting.  I've worked in indoor marijuana grow facilities for around 12 years up until earlier this year and high CO2 was always viewed as a hazard.  We would even use extremely high CO2 levels as a pesticide.

Ambient CO2 levels were around 300-340ppm, our burners would keep the rooms to 1250ppm, for pest removal I think we would go 10,000ppm+.  There are warning all over these products of the dangers of long exposure to high CO2 levels.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'll just have to do more research when I get some time.  Not that it's relevant to my work anymore, I'm just genuinely curious.",0,,,4,conspiracy
zmlyzq,7,"I bet you that at those levels, that your plants and buds were probably huge, and had very vigorous growth.

But yes, at really high levels CO2 will displace oxygen and if a human were to enter that environment while the levels were that high, it would likely harm (or kill) you. But if that system was self contained, after about a month or so, the plants would use up all that available CO2 and in return produce more O2.",0,,,3,conspiracy
zmlyzq,8,"So it does seem that on the O2/CO2 concerns that a tolerable homeostasis is inevitable.  Excluding maybe if there were mass extinctions of O2 breathing creatures or something else catastrophic.

Something else related I encountered while growing was that once the plants experienced higher than normal CO2 levels they wouldn't react as positively to our usual levels.  We would have to exceed the previous levels to get a visual rapid boost in those plants again.  If that's true for perennials (even just seasonally) then it would probably act as an added buffer to keep O2 levels from skyrocketing dangerously.

The only concern I could see from increased plant growth would be maybe excess combustible material in the fall possibly leading to more frequent and less manageable forest fires.  Who knows though.  

I guess the more relevant info would be what's the status of the current O2 levels.",0,,,2,conspiracy
zmlyzq,9,"Historically, the O2 levels in the modern era are much lower than any other time in the earth's history (at least since the time we have had an atmosphere). 

I've seen studies and research that hypothesized that the reason why some plants/animals (and the accounts of humans living to abnormal ages, like Noah) is due to the abundance of O2 (and CO2 for plants) that used to be in the atmosphere, and that the reason why we (humans) ""capped"" at a max lifespan of 140, is becuase we do not get enough O2 to sustain life that long anymore. 

I don't know if I fully believe that hypothesis, but I think it would be an intriguing feild of study/experiments. I do know there is evidence that oxygen therapy reduces the speed at which  aging occurs.
