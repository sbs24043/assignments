This article didn't mention it, but amaranth (rajgira) is a particularly good exotic grain because the yield (500-900 kg per acre) is lower than the other exotic grains they discussed, but it grows like a weed and it's extremely tolerant of heat and drought, so it still produces a good yield when drought kills every other grain.",0,,,1378,science

**Fossil Fuels**

Lets get ONE thing straight: Commercial scale grid power generation is NOT the problem here. And that probably runs counter to everything you have been told, and everything the media shares. In reality, we can retrofit old generators and filter something like 90% of the emissions out. We can take a new build and get pretty damn near 100% out. Toss in some minor additional efforts and very quickly we have a net negative output from the combined project.

We don't need perfect: We need better then perfect - and for power generation at a commercial level? It's fine.

Where it's not fine? Unfiltered gas / oil heating - for homes, greenhouses, and more. It's not fine when we aren't using the filtering technology we have available.

Eventually we will want to move onto something other then fossil fuels - but, the thing is: If we can synthetically make a petrol alternative that is a drop in replacement that as a whole, through partial filtering etc nets us a net-negative on carbon emissions using the technology: there isn't a problem in using fossil fuels.

What we do need to do, is move away from fossil fuels as a primary means for fueling our transportation.

**Agriculture**

Rice is bad, sort of. Meat is worse - from a water stand point, from a land use stand point, and from a emissions stand point: it's bad. It's wasteful. And I AM NOT giving it up. Oh and impossible meat substitute? Ain't that much better - but at least it's vegetarian.

Lab grown meat is actually interesting. It reduces the land use problem, it reduces the water use problem and overall provides a solution to the meat consuming lovers while reducing the strain on the environment and other related issues. But in the same vein - Synthetically generated protiens and, by extension, as we solve that problem, synthetically synthesized vitamins is a very real interesting potential for providing sustenance to a lot of people while reducing overall land need: And we can build the factories that produce these things pretty well anywhere that has access to some amount of water + CO2 source (say next to a fossil fuel burning plant or an incinerator).

On top of this, hydroponics and home growing of suplemental vegitables and herbs is a very good option. Not only does it provide some food that will pay for itself over the long run, but it also provides better air quality within the home. Where space is available to, it would be a worthwhile investment.

**Transportation**

Cars, Planes, boats. We aren't giving them up - but we can do better, a lot better. Planes and Boats are probably the one place I see hydrogen fuel as being a viable alternative: It's energy dense, and the tanks can be separated sufficiently from the passengers to be safe while shielded sufficiently.

But even if we can't get to carbon-less fuel, if we can synthesize the fuel in a way that results in being carbon neutral: that is a big win.

**Energy Generation**

Reality check: We aren't giving up fossil fuels - and largely, we don't need to. Not fully at least - we do need to reduce our dependency on them, and should be aiming to phase them out for the most part completely.

But depending on grid-scale transitions isn't enough, especially as energy demands grow over time. This is where small scale solar and wind installations kick in. For something like 50k investment you could take your house off the central power grid and be just fine. But you could spend as little as 5-10k and supplement your home use.

Nuclear is a very strong option. And in all the discussions - throium reactors really get ignored, something India was (is?) working on.

The conjecture I've heard is that GMOs:

a) Have less genetic diversity than our regular crops.

b) Encourage monocultures due to their very useful alterations and the concerning business models that can surround them.

So therefore, disease outbreaks that overcome their resistance will be much more likely, much faster and much more dire - due to their eventual commonality and low genetic diversity.

Both this concern, and the previous, are less to do with GMOs in-and-of-themselves and more about the industry surrounding them. Proper regulation could probably address these concerns easily.",0,,,17,science
e7hp20,8,"Well your points are a bit iffy.

Plants don't have many resistance genes to the same disease. If even in nature plants often only have 1 gene that protects them from a disease. If that fails or the disease evolves around it. We are fucked because we don't have another gene to protect crops with. Against some diseases we don't even have resistance genes. If we find a resistance gene it will be bred into pretty much every commercial variety available on the market in years right now.

Advanced GMO technology's will allow us to make multi layered defenses for our crops. Instead of now having 1 gene protecting we might get 5 different genes each working in a different way protecting the crops. 

Mono cultures are not a bad thing. If you believe that then you have never worked in a large field. Mono cultures allow efficiency and with crop rotation, cover crops, integrated pest management and other modern agricultural methods produce food more sustainable than any other method available. Without mono cultures many of these technology's would be impossible or utterly impractical

Every crop is different. Every breed is different. How are we supposed to tailor a nutrient blend for 4 different crops in one field growing in mixed positions. How am i going to harvest 1 crop in a field without damaging the other 3 crops.

e7hp20,0,Sorghum is a very good alternative to people with either or both Coeliac and Rice allergies.,0,,,2,science
e7hp20,0,"Rice is the staple here. Farmers could plant less rice but the Indian government will have to create awareness of the alternatives.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the government introduced technologies for increasing yield for farmers as the country was in a crisis for food and was importing. This changed the way India ate. It's often called the Green Revolution here. 
In Tamil Nadu, there were more than 100 varieties of rice and people actively ate millets and other sustainable grains which required much less water. After Green revolution, this stopped and Ponni Rice dominated the market in Tamil Nadu as it's yield was much higher.
Now, we might be producing a surplus of grains but we have lost so many varieties of them. Returning to them will be really difficult for farmers as there is really very less demand. The government should create awareness of these alt-grains to the public and grow a market for the farmers to switch to. 
(Indian market is very highly controlled by the Government with schemes and policies for small businesses like farming. A substantial change can't be brought about without widespread government intervention and subsidy)",0,,,2,science

e7hp20,0,I thought I'd read/watched a docu somewhere that said rice in India was a GMO share crop and they made so much of it and so exclusively was because they were pretty much enslaved by the patent holders and poverty. How is introducing these other crops going to help? Are they going to just GMO those and switch them? Can the patent holders make a large scale switch like that and still be profitable enough to warrant investment into 3rd world markets?,0,,,6,science
