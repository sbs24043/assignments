ldopk,0,"It's great to see actual studies in systems that really need it, but I think it is nothing that wasn't already understood... anyway, please consider x-posting to r/ecology :)",0,,,9,science
ldopk,1,"This is exactly the sort of thing we need to see more of.  Applying known ecological techniques to build better functioning manmade ecological systems.  Engineering, basically. ",0,,,5,science
ldopk,2,"This kind of engineering you speak of is called ""permaculture""",0,,,9,science

ldopk,3,"That's a part of it, certainly.  But I think it could be applied more broadly than just agriculture.",0,,,1,science
ldopk,4,Permaculture is way more broad than agriculture.  ,0,,,5,science
ldopk,2,"It's fascinating really. We're reaching this sort of ""X=Y+Z"" point where every scientific field is converging with every other field. Chemistry compliments biology compliments ecology, all backed by ethical ideas developed in philosophy, and the end result is food for starving people.",0,,,3,science
ldopk,3,My professor tells me that everything has to be integrative these days.  You can't pick one field and ignore everything else...you have to at least collaborate with people studying all sorts of things.,0,,,4,science
ldopk,0,"Technically plants do not fix nitrogen, bacteria that live in their roots do.",0,,,28,science
ldopk,1,"However, plants attract the bacteria using Nod factors and facilitate the formations of nodules in which these grow.

This statement is equivalent to someone mentioning a human digesting food, to which someone else replies: ""Humans don't digest food, enzymes in their body and bacteria in their gut do.""",0,,,7,science

ldopk,1,"The paper is called:

> Agricultural success from Africa: the case of fertilizer tree systems in southern Africa (Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe)",0,,,5,science
ldopk,2,"Those are all in Southeast Africa. They should denote that from the outset. Treating Africa as a monolith undercuts the ability of its individual nations to support and champion their successes, because they are inevitably thrown in with the abysmal failures of almost completely unrelated regions.",0,,,1,science
ldopk,1,"The article mentions East Africa and places similar to Malawi (which is the Southeast, near Madagascar).  It generalizes as places with high population densities, as these places cannot lay their fields fallow like lower population areas (such as Zambia) can.",0,,,3,science
ldopk,0,Why would this boost crop yields only in Africa?,0,,,2,science
ldopk,1,Many nitrogen-fixing plants are used to increase crop yields all over the world. I.E. wheat/soybean rotations.The struggle is finding ones that are highly drought and heat tolerant to survive African Climates.,0,,,5,science
ldopk,1,"Fair question! Obviously the answer is that it doesn't, but if the study site was Africa you can only say in certainly that it applies in Africa, if you know what I mean :)

It's a fairly well known phenomenon though, but itâ€™s good to see that the science is being applied in sites that need it the most.

ldopk,0,"""Remember, genes are NOT blueprints. This means you can't, for example, insert ""the genes for an elephant's trunk"" into a giraffe and get a giraffe with a trunk. There are no genes for trunks. What you CAN do with genes is chemistry, since DNA codes for chemicals. For instance, we can in theory splice the native plants' talent for nitrogen fixation into a terran plant.""

Maybe this would all be easier if they would all just live where the **FOOD IS!  YOU LIVE IN A FUCKING DESERT!  NOTHING GROWS OUT HERE!  NOTHING'S GONNA GROW OUT HERE!**

See this?  Yeah?  Yeah!  This is sand.  Yeah... you know what it's going to be a hundred years from now?  **IT'S GONNA BE SAND!**
