wup9a4,0,"This is one of my specialities working in integrated pest management and entomology.

The headline the OP chose can be a bit misleading for those not familiar with the terminology. The decrease in natural enemies is not good thing, as it's natural enemies of the pests, not the crop plants. When you click through the study itself, the benefits were really only apparent in shaded crops, so not your typical crop situation. 

In general, we don't really consider ants to be major natural enemies in farm fields, even outside of aphids (e.g., honeydew producers). Usually it's going to be other insects like lady beetles, parasitoid wasps, lacewings, pirate bugs, and a bunch of other predatory true bugs. For many crops, ants are a sign you have a problem. The article does delve into the disservices from ants, but I'm wary of how the overall results could be glossed over easily if someone isn't careful.",0,,,266,science
wup9a4,1,I will chime in and say beneficial insects are important. Some neighbors were unable to get fruit from their garden(watermelon and pumpkins). I was able to pinpoint the problem as pesticides. Nothing could pollinate their plants due to the pesticides.,0,,,57,science
wup9a4,2,"And that's exactly why ants are an absolute terror for pumpkin and melon growers. Those are honeydew producing plants that aphids love, and require pesticides.

Aphids will completely cover flower and developing buds, and kill them so they can't be pollinated, all while the ants ferry then around and protect them.

Things like ladybugs or mantis are great at eating aphids, but ants will attack them to protect the aphids, and aren't very feasible at scale.

The only real organic solution outside of using safer soap suds (dissolves aphid bodies) or diatomaceous earth (like really fine sand that irritates aphids), is to use a pesticide. Thankfully something like pyrethrine (chrysanthemum flower extract) is mostly non-toxic to humans, but very effective against ants and aphids.",0,,,36,science
wup9a4,3,For home gardeners it's worth noting pyrethrin insecticides are harmful to cats and extremely toxic to fish. Definitely be conscious of where run off tldrains to and it's affect on your local ecosystem.,0,,,28,science
wup9a4,3,"I use diatomaceous earth and occasional soap suds(dish soap) in my garden and I have only one pumpkin plant this year, and right now only one pumpkin but it is very large. It is really all we need. My neighbors planted too early and already picked their two, no good, pathetic mini pumpkins(they weren’t supposed to be small). I use a lot of water that is used to soak pots and dishes in my garden to water due to the drought. The drought is also why I planted one pumpkin plant but it is more than doing it’s job. I will likely only plant two again next year(they don’t all make it). I also have a lot of lace wings in my garden. I haven’t actually seen them but I’ve seen tons and tons of eggs and some larvae as well. Lots of ladybugs too.",0,,,5,science

wup9a4,2,"Not the same guy, but I've also studied entomology related to agriculture.


As he said, ant are a problem when there are aphids (or some other honeydew producing insect) present, as they effectively ""herd"" these bugs to collect the honeydew they produce, and defend them from predators.


So the ants themselves aren't the problem, the aphids are, but they hinder your attempt to fight the aphids with other predators.


Also aphids can be difficult to spot in a field, so the presence of ants can be an indicator of their presence.",0,,,23,science

wup9a4,1,"> What farmer wants to increase the abundance of honeydew producing pests.

The study found that the net effect is positive, for shaded crops, organic agriculture, and agroforestry in particular:

> ""Our results indicate that disservices (mean effect size: with absolute values = 0.40) such as the increased abundance of honeydew-producing pests and decreased abundance of natural enemies are outweighed by biological control ecosystem services provided by ants. Overall, the mere presence of ants, regardless of their body size, provided pivotal services for crops (mean effect size: with absolute values = 0.55) such as the decreased abundance of non-honeydew-producing pests, decreased plant damage and increased crop yield corroborating, at least partially, most of our hypotheses.""

The paper explains this effect elsewhere:

> ""Finally, the crop system also modulated the effect of ants on plant damage. As ant diversity may increase in plant-richness environments [68] such as shaded crops [67], whereby ants tend to increase the predation rate [36,66]. These effects can directly reflect in the reduction of plant damage and consequently in the increase in crop yield (figure 3b,c). Therefore, shaded crops, as well as other crop systems like organic agriculture and agroforestry [64], can enhance the beneficial services provided by ants (e.g. pest control) that increase the economic benefits to farmers.""",0,,,5,science
