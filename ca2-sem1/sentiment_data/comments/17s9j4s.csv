17s9j4s,0,welcome to the true pain that we all feel daily,0,,,392,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Glad to know Iâ€™ll have a support group for the coming misery,0,,,142,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Malachite Blind pests and elder lemurians have ass blasted me more times than I care to admit, welcome to the shitshow, friend",0,,,23,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"I hope the complaining and wait was worth it, because now console gets to face the true final bosses, Blind pests and Larva",0,,,242,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,I picked up the log book for blind pests after killing my first one and thought it was neat until I turned around and got mugged by 8 of them at once.,0,,,50,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,*notes down* Blind pests have evolved to the point of laying trapsâ€¦,0,,,29,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,I mean I think the logbook says theyâ€™re ambush predators.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,That's about what I'd expect,0,,,3,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,It was a bad time to be playing railgunner.,0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"Console honestly had the true final boss already before they patched it. Because of a bug, any enemy with fire was a run ender. They did so much damage that if you got hit by a single attack, you were dead then and there.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,On console once I stacked fireworks so much it crashed my game. Now fireworks is my one true enemy,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,I no longer insta die from fire so I'll take the trade off,0,,,75,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Instead youâ€™ll insta die from collapse,0,,,89,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Someone didnt take armor plates,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Unless you had 40 of them it wouldnâ€™t matter, pre-SOTV update for console had flaming elites deal an absurd amount of damage. Basically an instant kill anytime after stage 2.",0,,,6,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,Thats bizarre the flaming elites were already scary idk why they made them scarier. And only for console which is even weirder.,0,,,0,riskofrain
17s9j4s,4,"It was a glitch. Also the hit box of their fire trail was massive, flying enemies would basically kill you just by existing in your vicinity",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Their only redeeming feature is the tongue. Makes em look silly,0,,,81,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,No. It makes them look like theyâ€™re mocking you. Which they are. When they show up in a horde and just take you down like a firing squad. And the blazing ones. Jesus christ,0,,,115,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,Dude the elite one is what inspired me to post this in the first place ðŸ¤¬ him and a buddy sync shot me and and ended an otherwise solid start to a run and then stuck those mocking ass tongues at me as my railgunner goes limp ðŸ˜”,0,,,45,riskofrain

17s9j4s,2,"Voidtouched Blind Pest

That is all",0,,,9,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,I disagree - the little waddle they do with their little feet when they land/are grounded is better!,0,,,7,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Nah looks like some Mario shit lol. Not knocking but it donâ€™t fit. Insult to injury,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Couple stacks of collapse also another run ender from void enemies.,0,,,29,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"Mfs when they take 3 stacks of collapse:

Guess Iâ€™ll die",0,,,9,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,">couple

Check out Mr.Infusions over here, able to survive more than one stack of collapse.",0,,,7,riskofrain

17s9j4s,1,Where have you been?,0,,,43,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Uhh...working :(

Also uhh...Darktide.",0,,,12,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,Ps5 gamers shed a tear every time that word is uttered,0,,,6,riskofrain
17s9j4s,4,"""*working*""

Lol, in all seriousness, Darktide is so good.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"Yes, and console now has the void dlc",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"Yeh. Also Returns is out, and they announced the next DLC (which console fans will probably get on time because iirc they redid the whole console codebase to match the PC codebase).",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,They do so much damage even on stage 1,0,,,13,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Glad thereâ€™s another hater these bastards are a pain in the ass. Because theyâ€™re another flying enemy that can spawn in groups but unlike wisps you canâ€™t usually one shot them with some abilities.,0,,,12,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,they are flying lemurians with the accuracy of wisp,0,,,5,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"as a pc player whoâ€™s been playing since the DLC came out, these **Motherfuckers** do not ever get less irritating",0,,,9,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,i hate this motherfucker,0,,,9,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,I love the look of them because they remind me of something but I canâ€™t pinpoint what,0,,,6,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"Rolling Stones album cover, maybe? Or RHPS's opening?",0,,,6,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Kuriboh,0,,,4,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Had the audacity to call them 'blind' as well ðŸ¤£,0,,,5,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,They have a very good sense of smell.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,These cunts don't have eyes they shouldn't be so fucking accurate when sniping me from across the fucking map,0,,,5,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,They can taste your anger.,0,,,3,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,They smell your fear when they spawn.,0,,,3,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Welcome to our hell,0,,,4,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,These fuckers kill me far more than any enemy,0,,,3,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"Itâ€™s great seeing console people experiencing the raw hatred that the pc players had (and still have), welcome to the club",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"in an homage of risk of rain im currently working on i have removed these annoying bastards in place of a cicada, aswell as the rats in place of some fuzzy lookin bugs",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"OH GOD NOT THE ARCHER BUG.

In all honesty Iâ€™ve been playing returns and the archer bugs arenâ€™t that bad.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"All the remade enemies are original, some enemies are reimagined, like the tar enemies or the wisps but the cicadas charge at you based on sound and orbit the player like a vulture; and turn into kamikaze fire bombs on death and the vermin alts group up and create electrical discharges in high numbers.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"Not sure why, but I took to calling these things ""Jeremy"" whilst playing with my buddies. All the boys hate Jeremy.",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Poor Jerma.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"Gearbox made him, same with the void enemies and the insta kill bullshit.

I just hope SotS is more balanced man...",0,,,-56,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"they didnâ€™t, gearbox only made jailers, sanctuary and siphoned forest",0,,,32,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,they also made borderlands 2,0,,,25,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,"true, they should add that in the dlc",0,,,25,riskofrain
17s9j4s,4,I can't wait for the entirety of Borderlands 2 to be included as a secret unlockable,0,,,20,riskofrain
17s9j4s,5,Considering how much Gearbox loves their baby (borderlands) I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they added ROR cosmetics in their game.,0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Oh shit they did siphoned forest

That's probably my favorite dlc map. Good job, gearbox",0,,,9,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,Do we know who did Sundered Grove?,0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,"I think it was stadia devs? Could be entirely wrong but I do know it was a stadia exclusive, and I wish it stayed that way.",0,,,3,riskofrain
17s9j4s,4,IMO the only bad thing about Sundered is the boss pool (and thus the possible boss items). Actual garbage unless youâ€™re lucky enough to get a wisp event. Why donâ€™t Grovetenders normally spawn on a stage with GROVE IN ITS NAME?!,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,5,I just hate how big it is. I wish they split it in half like they did with Titanic Plains. Let the upper level and middle areas be one stage variant and the bottom area and middle area be another variant.,0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,5,"It's got too much verticality with too few pathways and sectioned off parts of the map. Which makes getting around it in the first loop terrible. The other stage 4 options are open with multiple pathways to get high up and usually only one area that's sectioned off from the rest of the map. If it could only spawn after you loop, then it might be less hated. Also, looking for glowing mushrooms around that big ass map to get the gold chest is annoying.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,"I have never died to a void enemy beyond the first time, but I play hyper mobile survivors like merc and huntress, so yeah.",0,,,11,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Void Jailers are actually pretty dangerous, their pull attack is quite hard to dodge (especially if you're playing... basically anyone _other_ than Merc and Huntress) _and_ immobilizes you for a couple seconds, and the shotgun attack they use immediately afterward can chunk you for huge damage.

Not to mention the possibility of being pulled into _other_ dangerous enemies - a Void Jailer was responsible for, I believe, my only death ever to a Void Reaver implosion.",0,,,2,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,"Fighting against 2 or more Void Jailers is hell, that BULLSHIT pull attack can inmobilize you out of your mobility abilities if they pull you more than once.

I've lost quite a few run against them before i started taking them seriously.",0,,,-12,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,People bitch ab the blind pest way too much but the hardest enemy is the void barnacle imo.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,3,Void barnacles literally donâ€™t moveâ€¦,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,4,Tbf I mostly play simulacrum where you can't just ignore them,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,5,Ah I see. Yeah they seem a lot worse there because you also donâ€™t have as much room to strafe and dodge them.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,I have never died to them but they are anoying thu just keep spawning,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,The ground rats have been worse for me and my friends.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,Yeah but they redeemed themselves with the Gups,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Gup my beloved.,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"Ahh itâ€™s so nice looking at the console players suffering now as much as we did before. A wax quail will be useful when dodging their attacks, and if you arenâ€™t able to dodge, seek cover as soon as you hear their attack sound. Playing around it lets you get them while they recharge.",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,SOTV been out for over 1 year and I only just now noticed Blind Pests have nostrils on their lips,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,EWW,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,"Their behavior is predictable; they will always flap towards you and try to get closer. They are tanky unlike wisps and do a lot more damage, but they don't try to predict your movement so as long as you know where they are then you can dodge pretty easily",0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,1,Literally just keep moving and they do nothing lol,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,2,Me stopping for half a second to scrap only for 5 blind pests to spawn as soon as I enter the scrapper UI and immediately kill me,0,,,1,riskofrain

17s9j4s,0,The problem is that these things hover so much higher than other flying enemies. Itâ€™s almost impossible to look up enough to see them,0,,,1,riskofrain
17s9j4s,0,The blind pest and Xi construct are wonderful additions to survivors to the void!,0,,,1,riskofrain
