Because that number needs to be significantly lower than the amount removed by the crushed rock in order to be useful; I know that it obvious so I'm assuming that is part of what they measured.",0,,,6,climatechange
1bygn7t,1,"If you'd bother to read the paper, you'd find that the basalt is a commonly utilized fertilizer and soil amendment. It just also happens to sequester carbon, as established in the experiment. No ""extra"" machining or transporting.",0,,,4,climatechange
1bygn7t,1,Funny how you think they actually care at the net impact.  They seem to want disregard what does not fit the narrative.,0,,,-2,climatechange

1bygn7t,0,Sweet! I‚Äôve been getting tired of the doomerism around here. Glad we solved the climate change problem.,0,,,1,climatechange

1bygn7t,0,"35 billion tons of CO2 per year would require 8,750,000,000 hectares or \~9 billion to round it up. That is the area we need to add on a planet with just [13 billion hectares of land](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+land+is+on+planet+earth+in+hectares). I am ignoring the fact that putting that CO2 into the food, means that it gets released once the food has been eaten.

And that is just to compensate for yearly release, not for previous decades, in a magical world where the production, collection and burying of this material doesn't release any CO2. In reality: this process would release many times more CO2 that it would capture, just like every other carbon capture scam.",0,,,0,climatechange
1bygn7t,1,"Every solution helps a bit, especially when offsetting ag to feed to the planet. 

We don't eat 100% of the plants we grow. There are many options to continue sequestration of unused material.",0,,,2,climatechange
1bygn7t,2,"This is not a solution but a scam funded by fossil fuel industry. Now voters have a new vaporware dangling in front of them, instead of putting pressure on politicians to change things. And who do politicians sleep with? Yes, you guessed it: fossil fuel industry.

And please read what I wrote. Putting CO2 into food is dumb; it requires energy, that energy production releases lots of CO2... for nothing. Once the food has been eaten, it goes back into the atmosphere.",0,,,-1,climatechange
1bygn7t,3,"They're not putting CO2 into food; the study talks about sequestering the carbon into soil. Building topsoil is a pretty solid nature-based solution for sequestering CO2. 

It's indeed problematic if politicians try to use things like this to justify business as usual, but that doesn't mean the solution itself has no merit. If used as one of many changes to make our systems sustainable, then it's a good solution.

Anyway, you're throwing the word scam around while also appearing to not have read or understood the study.",0,,,2,climatechange
1bygn7t,3,"I read what you wrote. You intentionally mischaracterized the study, its effects, and are now lying about funding.

Again, since you completely ignored what I said: *humans and animals do not consume 100% of the plant their food is grown from.* I'm not sure what's so difficult for you to understand about that. 

But go ahead, keep criticizing everything. You're under no obligation to actually assist in producing solutions.",0,,,4,climatechange
