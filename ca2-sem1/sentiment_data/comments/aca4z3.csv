Edit:grammar",0,,,202,science
aca4z3,2,"Another commenter touched on this elsewhere in the thread. Basically, it  may make the plant less robust. If the pathway has been optimized for reducing energy waste, there is likely a decrease in other metabolic intermediaries. 


Therefore, if the efficient plant and the natural plant are subject to some evolutionary pressure that requires the redundant intermediaries for survival - for example, a pathogen which is inhibited by the intermediate - the  natural plant may do better.",0,,,216,science

aca4z3,2,"Plants used to exist in a oxygen-poor environment. Only recently has rubisco carboxylation had to compete with photorespiration, so most C3 plants deal with 2-phosphoglycolate by breaking it down through a series of energetically expensive reactions that result in oxygen radicals, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. There may be a signalling cascades involved with photorespiration, NADH/NAD+ ratios, and malate/glutamate pools in the mitochondria, but I can't think of any costly consequence to decreasing photorespiration. C4 plants minimize photorespiration almost completely, and they're doing just fine. Though C4 plants have been the evolutionary new kid on the block for the past 50 million years and only make up 3% of the plant population on earth, they account for 23% of the total carbon fixation of all terrestrial plants. I'm a phd student in plant science. Let me know if you have any more questions",0,,,152,science

aca4z3,3,"I would say that photosynthesis emerged during a time when oxygen was poor, but the earths oxygen levels have fluctuated across geologic time. For example, during the carboniferous period, there was such a high concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere that insect size increased dramatically since they absorb oxygen passively rather than active absorption like vertebrates. This massive amount of oxygen would have had severe consequences on the plants at that time too (~300 million years ago before the carboniferous). 
Maybe during those times, alternative solutions to photorespiration had emerged in more basal plant lineages but was lost during the series of mass extinction events before the rise and dominance of angiosperms?

aca4z3,4,"Plausible, but impossible to test. I'm not an evolutionary biologist, but my understanding of evolution is that organisms will maximize their fitness within their niche. but if that niche changes, the organism publishes a response or perishes. A great paper to read on this very topic equates C3-C4 evolution to a mount Fuji shaped fitness landscape, I highly recommend it. Those unknown mechanisms you propose may have been inefficient, energetically expensive, or simply not needed when oxygen levels later declined, but my thoughts on the matter are purely conjecture. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.058.",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,3,How does one find the specific genes to modify for something like this? And how do you modify it? CRISPR?,0,,,4,science
aca4z3,4,"That depends on whether or not the organism's genome or parts of the genome are sequenced and published. Tobacco's genome has been sequenced, which makes research easier. You blast genomes for a particular conserved gene like phosphoglycerate phosphatase. You then design primers to cut out the gene, and amplify it with PCR, then get the gene sequenced to confirm the pcr was successful. You can go a couple different routes from here, CRISPR/CAS being one of them. You up-regulate and down regulate the gene, find out where the protein is transported and active, and cross your fingers. ",0,,,5,science
aca4z3,3,Is cannabis C3 or C4?,0,,,3,science
aca4z3,4,"Best answer I can give you is probably C3, but maybe a C3/C4 intermediate. I pulled the following quote from the Results and Discussions section from Chandra et al. 2011, doi: 10.1007/s12298-011-0066-6   ""The increase in PN due to the short term increase in CO2 concentration is reported to be primarily because of an increase in carboxylation efficiency and secondarily, due to the reduction in photorespiration (Minorsky 2002). However, the magnitude of enhancement was reported to be species and genotype/variety specific. It has also been reported that doubling of ambient CO2 concentration increases PN in the plant species whose photosynthesis is not saturated by the present ambient CO2 level (Joshi 2006). Since photosynthesis of C3 plant species is not saturated at the present ambient CO2 concentration, these plants are thus reported to benefit more than C4 plants (Bowes 1993; Joshi 2006).""",0,,,3,science
aca4z3,3,"Please sir, may we have a simpler set of words, I’m five!",0,,,5,science
aca4z3,4,"Sure. These scientists added genes to a well known plant to increase it's efficiency to take in carbon dioxide, which SHOULD increase growth and possibly yield. The genes added shouldn't hurt the plant because the genes shortcut the photorespiratory pathway, which should still be intact. 
",0,,,4,science
aca4z3,3,Will this mean plants with this new gene will absorb more carbon from the air?  If all plants had this gene could it impact climate change by whole percentage points?,0,,,3,science
aca4z3,4,"""Yes"" to your first question. ""No"" to your second question; the scale of production required to pull that off would be impossible. If you were able to pull it off and change EVERY photosynthetic organism on earth to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air, I'll quote G-Man: ""Prepare for unforeseen consequences.""",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,5,"Yeah excess O2 in the atmosphere is by far an incredibly risky action to put it mildly.  (One spark and boom!).  Not to mention the loss of diversity this could cause.   I’m just toying around with the idea in my head that these might useful in the (many many) steps to reduce the carbon load in the air, if things get to a point where we littlerally have no options but “risky” ones, using these plants might be a cheaper alternative to the more drastic ideas out there.",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,2,Ya I’m wondering this as well. Maybe there were reasons that glitch exists.,0,,,46,science
aca4z3,3,"It exists at photosynthesis evolved in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen was a toxic byproduct, but there was none in the atmosphere. Releasing a little into the air won't make any difference, right?

aca4z3,5,"Exactly. Evolution optimises with the steps it has available... It finds a local minima.

You could also argue that the new animal that arrives in the environment is evolution in action... ",0,,,9,science
aca4z3,4,Isn't this a little different than a single species filling a niche when this process is present in most crop species as opposed to a single outlier? ,0,,,5,science
aca4z3,5,"No, because it still does not detract from the fact that evolutionary traits become prevalent as a result of trying to cope or survive, not optimize, within an environment.

It didn't start out this way with photosynthesis, and is an evolutionary on-the-go fix to the levels of 02 in the atmosphere.",0,,,23,science
aca4z3,5,"If all crop species evolved from a single ancestor, which it should since our current model contains a last universal common ancestor (LUCA), then this ancestor would likely have been the first to develop photosynthesis. Or at the very least was the first to absorb the anaerobic organism responsible for photosynthesis. If there was a inefficient process, but not deleterious, then it would have been kept.",0,,,7,science
aca4z3,3,"This has been the case before. ""Junk DNA"" is not junk any more. Humans just didn't understand it had a purpose. These assumptions seem potentially dangerous.",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,4,"The question is whether the environmental pressures which led to it being created/spread in the first place are still issues in modern times. Maybe a chunk of 'junk' is a mechanism for handling something which might easily return, or maybe it's a response to something the plant's ancestor went through three million years ago and it's pretty unlikely to recur.

Plus, of course, the spaghetti-code nature of DNA means that any junk-chunk might be the result of *several* of these factors - just because there's speculation it might have protected against, say, consumption by mastodons, doesn't necessarily mean that it's not also useful to protect against sudden frosts or squirrels.

I think we're going to have to get a lot more advanced with DNA-growth and environmental simulations in order to be able to map out the full results of making any given change. Even then, we're going to have to decide whether to implement things that (for instance) might result in a 20% crop yield improvement under ideal circumstances while making the plant 3% slower to grow and 1.8% tastier to locusts, or some such.",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,2,"This is actually quite likely. The plant only has access to a limited amount of nitrogen and phosphorus from the soil. The nitrogen plants get from the soil is used to make amino acids and proteins. This is what makes up the protein content of plants.

Plants are the single largest source of protein to our race, and all other protein sources we have (Meat) are basically indirectly from plants. The animal will eat plants its whole life, getting protein from them, then we eat the animal and get a lot of good protein from it.

The only issue is that because plants can only get so much nitrogen from the soil, but there is more biomass total, the nitrogen has to be spread out more because there is a limited amount to be drawn from the soil. Its the same amount being spread out over a larger amount of biomass, meaning the actual protein content from anywhere you sample will likely be lower.

One potential way to combat this is to give the plants more nitrogen (Fertilizer), but this is a whole other issue I wont go into now.


TL;DR - It will likely lower protein ( and other nutrient) content because the plant is spreading the same amount of nutrients into more biomass.",0,,,3,science
aca4z3,2,"For sure.  But crops are already so far from natural that you may as well think of them as separate from natural evolution.  They're like breeds of dogs, they can't really even function as wolves anymore.",0,,,2,science
aca4z3,2,Yeah I was thinking a similar thing. We are calling a evolutionary adaptation of a system that has existed before us a glitch. ,0,,,2,science
aca4z3,2,well from the article it sounds like the photorespiratory process was created by plants to prevent the toxins from absorbing oxygen into itself. so if the plants over oxiginate the planet again they will suffocate in oxygen and have no way to prevent themselves from starving via their previous regulator -photorespiration.,0,,,2,science
aca4z3,2,There are definitely evolutionary consequences for this. The problem is that its nigh impossible for test for. Actual application in the field and seeing what happens is the only way to tell how it will affect the world.

aca4z3,8,"If someone owns a technology that gives them a stranglehold on markets by undercutting existing producers its a problem.  

Robustness is not having mega farms growing mega crops.  Robustness is a lot of small producers growing robust crops.

Our current problem is that our farming methods degrade the soil, and plants that grow 40% faster are just going to make all that worse.  ",0,,,17,science
aca4z3,9,"On the flip side human civilization is inevitably headed to a future of not enough water, energy or food to meet our needs.  We have the tools now to make food in factories at industrial scale.  It's only a matter of when, not if, this happens.  We will grow our food under artificial light and using a fraction of the water. 

We will also get a huge portion of our meat from labs as well.  Real animal agriculture uses too much land and energy.  If we replaced standard western agriculture with factory farming and meat products we could shrink our land footprint by at least half.

Soil issues are known, and they already have their solutions. There are crop rotation schedules that significantly reduce soil degradation and potentially allow farmers to use the same territories for centuries.

This happens in both c3 and c4 plants, however c4 plants have a mechanism they use in order to concentrate the CO2 they do have access too into the places they need it, while c3 plants have no such mechanism.

This ultimately leads to c3 plants performing more photorespiration than c4 plants. Because the nature of this breakthrough is centered around making photorespiration more efficient, it helps c3 plants more than c4 plants.

Advantages of Benthy:

* Growth: relatively short lifecycle, easy to grow indoors/greenhouses, reasonably disease resistant.

* Techniques: Benthy has nice broad leaves that can infiltrated with Agro for transformation.  Rather than trying to develop stable transformants (a pain in the ass), you can just infiltrate leaves.  Not only is it easier, it lets you do nice comparisons with different constructs all on the same leaf, repeated several times over a single plant.  You can really crank up the complexity and robustness of your experiment with relative ease.  Very powerful.  You can also do tissue culture, an important requirement for stable transgenics.

* Disease: TMV - tobacco mosaic virus - is another model organism and the combination of looking at this host/pathogen pair is the basis of much of our understanding of plant disease resistance.  Really fundamental stuff like Plant Innate Immunity, the hypersensitive response, R genes, etc. mostly come from Benthy research, often with powdery mildew (a fungal pathogen).  As one might imagine, lots of plant research is devoted to disease resistance.

aca4z3,0,"Botanist here! Some plants, like corn and other grasses, have evolved another way around it. These plants (using what is known as C4 photosynthesis) capture CO2 with Pep Carboxylase and pump it into the middle of the leaf. It is wet and isolated from excess O2, so Rubisco does not get confused and the Calvin cycle runs like normal. Problem is, all this extra machinery is hard to build (leaves are structured differently), so they are only competitive with C3 plants in hot/dry environments where C3 fails due to photorespiration.

In the engineered plants, it appears that Rubisco is still its derpy self, grabbing O2 instead of CO2 in hot/dry conditions with closed stomata (encouraging more oxygen). But, instead of using a lot of energy to recycle RuBP, the plants use an alternate pathway to reduce lost energy from this long involved pathway. Pretty awesome. 

It means that tomatoes with this pathway will grow just as well in hot and dry conditions as those in wet/cooler (provided water is still provided at the root). It may also mitigate some of the reduction in agricultural production that is predicted to happen as climate change warms the earth.  ",0,,,362,science

Plants are ridiculously inefficient at converting sunlight to energy. The ""typical"" conversion rate is 2%, which means that of all the sunlight energy that lands on any given crop, only 2% of it is used to create more biomass.

Any increase might seem low at these percentages, but consider exactly how much sunlight falls on these plants during the growing season.

Someon explained in a comment that the efficiency loss is due to redundant pathways that make the plant more robust in case of issues making it likely to survive longer.

aca4z3,2,"Its not quite that simple as ""it would be much more efficient so evolution would figure it out"". Blind iteration process like evolution always run the risk of finding a solution thats good, but not ideal, and getting stuck

Imagine a computer program designed to climb hills, with the goal of getting as high as possible. The bot is placed on a grid of squares, each at different heights. The bot cant see the field, it only knows how high it is now, and how high it was immediately before. A simple climbing program would be to tell the bot ""pick a random direction and move 1 step that way. If its lower than you were before, go back. If its higher, repeat the process"". This program is decent enough, it will get the robot to climb higher without needing to see the whole field. The problem is it can get stuck on a low hilltop. Not the highest hill top, just the nearest. If it gets to the second highest hilltop, every time it takes a step, it ends up lower than it was before, so it goes right back to that hill top. It will never reach the highest hilltop because each time it moves in any direction, it gets lower

Evolution can run into the same problem. Genetics is obviously vastly more complex, instead of one parameter changing, there are millions of genes which can change, and they can all change in different combinations. Its still fundamentally the same problem though. You can stumble into a lower peak where to get to further improvements, you would have to make significant changes to core functionality, meaning each little step results in worse chances of reproducing. Big changes can happen, but in general evolution happens in tiny steps rather than huge leaps. This can result in a species finding its self stuck on one of those lower peaks, where any small change is detrimental, even though things are being done inefficiently",0,,,5,science
aca4z3,3,"Great analogy.   


You're robot example is referred to in computer science as an explore/exploit and a optimal stopping problem.  Explore exploit is trading off between using energy to explore more versus exploiting the previous exploration. The best way to think about these problems is to explore more at the start of a new area (moved to a new place try a bunch of new restaurants) and exploit your knowledge more towards the end of an area (if you're moving away no point in hitting up a new restaurant which even if it's good you'll never go back and risk the chance of it being bad, when you can go to a favorite place you know will be good). Optimal stopping is a similar problem but usually there are constraints on how much you can go back (so if you date 10 girls you marry the next one you meet who is as good as your second or third best of the 10 previous, time is a factor and you've established what's out there and what you like, this is the optimal pattern for statistical wins, not a guarantee). So with the bot chosing squares you would want to teach it to explore enough to get a decent sample of how tall hills are around it, then stop at the next one decently above average. Still likely won't be the highest hill, but gives it the optimal chance.

aca4z3,1,"In fact, natural selection can often select things that don't work.  For example, a brightly coloured bird or fish might be easier to spot by a predator than a duller one. But, if said bright bird/fish is fast enough to avoid predators long enough to reach maturity, its colour becomes a sign of its other positive attributes. Because a slow bird/fish couldn't ""fake"" being fast by just being bright (because then it would be eaten), the flaw of being bright gets selected for in faster specimens.

We might see similar things in plants - eg. while it might seem beneficial for a plant to grow/reproduce quickly, there might be pressures selecting for specimens that live long periods of time. If that were the case, negative traits that stunt growth might actually be selected for.

In the case of this 40% inefficiency - perhaps this inefficiency is allowing plants that have some sort of weakness, e.g. prone to disease, to die off before reaching reproductive size/age. By a plant being inefficient, and STILL being able to survive long enough to reproduce, it is almost a guarantee that it has other strengths.",0,,,10,science

This fixes the problem where about 40% of these energy products (ATP and NADPH) are used up in the involved process that is regenerating RuBP after O2 is accidentally attached to it by Rubisco instead of CO2. 

This does not improve carbon fixation or use Pep Carboxylase. Rubisco continues to grab Oxygen on accident at the same rate as before. But the ATP and NADPH are not used up as quickly with the shortcut engineered into these plants. That means that they have more energy to turn into biomass! 

Note, this will only help plants that “suffer” from photorespiration, mostly ones in hot/dry environments. Plants under no water stress in cool areas will barely be helped with this “fix”. ",0,,,4,science

aca4z3,1,"Photosynthesis evolved in the absence of oxygen, so it actually was 100% “efficient” at that time, by our definition of efficiency in this thread (the carbon fixing enzyme rubisco attaches only CO2 to ribulose bisphosphate). Then photosynthesis made too much oxygen, leading to this “inefficiency” where rubisco also started attaching O2 to ribulose bisphosphate, so then photorespiration evolved to recycle that bastard molecule back into ribulose bisphosphate. 

Interestingly, the more “efficient” the rubisco variant is, the slower it is at fixing carbon [1], so photosynthetic organisms that use rubisco have to “make a choice” or evolve workarounds if they want efficiency vs speed, for example C4 or CAM photosynthesis, or carboxysomes. Also people have been trying to engineer a both fast and efficient carbon fixing enzyme for the past 20+ years and have not succeeded, so it does seem like nature really did find the best solution.

mutations impacting photosynthesis are probably tightly controlled, with even slight deviations being removed by natural selection due to reduced productivity or outright failure to survive. the genetic plasticity to evolve a way into the more efficient photosynthesis pathway is probably unlikely to occur unless it is relatively simple or with an early payoff.

kind of like how a blind person adrift at sea would desperately hold on to their life preserver, even if (unbeknownst to them) a life-saving ship was passing nearby and swimming to it would save their life. The life preserver is so crucial to survival that the blind person would never leave it behind in search of a possible better life. (not a perfect metaphor, but gets the idea across).

If nature was still improving photosynthesis a few million years ago, after going at it for hundreds of millions of years, it seems reasonable that we haven't found a global optimum yet. The universe is indeed still young.

aca4z3,1,"I'm willing to buy algae that contribute to terraforming Mars (over thousands of years), as there are already algae that persist under Earth's ice caps.

Venus, with its lead melt surface temperatures and sulfuric acid rain, is so far beyond the envelope of any known life that I'm dubious bioengineering would be part of the first few thousand years of any terraforming project. 

However, if nanotech self replicators are possible, then it should be possible to carpet Mercury with solar panels, refine magnesium and calcium from surface regolith, and loft it Mercury escape with really long equatorial railguns and towards Venus with self-deploying solar sails. Enough magnesium and calcium meteorites, and the CO2 precipitates out of the Venus's atmosphere as a thick layer of carbonates. See [https://www.universetoday.com/113412/how-do-we-terraform-venus/](https://www.universetoday.com/113412/how-do-we-terraform-venus/) After a few thousand years of this, one can redirect Kuiper belt ice bodies to provide some water (Venus lost nearly all its hydrogen after it went into runaway greenhouse). Install the sunshades at Sun-Venus L1, and  once the surface cools enough from all the impacts that water can condense, then we can look into bioengineered bacteria/algae.

Really, though, why would anyone want to live at the bottom of a gravity well if you didn't have to? The surface of Venus is 10.36 km/s from anywhere interesting, whereas there are much lower tech ways of building habitation amongst the asteroids, where one's just a fraction of a km/s from most rocks in the outer solar system.

Fun Venus fact:

Venus is Earth's sister planet, similar in size and composition and she also resides in the Goldilocks zone where liquid water, and life, could exist as far as we understand it.  


Given the similarities between Venus and Earth, it is likely that early Earth and Venus were quite similar.  But for whatever reason oceans, and life, took hold on Earth whereas on Venus any such environment was relatively short-lived.  As time went on, and our respective planets continued to pump out megatons of CO2 from volcanism, Earth fixed the CO2 whereas on Venus it keeps building up.  Today, Venus's atmosphere is 96.5% CO2 (Earth's is 0.04%).  But overall CO2 by mass on both planets are about the same.  

The difference is that on Earth, life and the oceans locked that CO2 up, into fossil fuels and into carbonate rocks (eg limestone).  If it weren't for these processes, our CO2 would have remained in the atmosphere as well and we'd have run into the same run-away greenhouse effect that did Venus in. 

Terra-forming Venus would require fixing a hell of a lot of CO2, something that took our planet literally billions of years and oceans of water to do.  We're trying to figure out how to deal with an excess of a few parts per million here on Earth.  Venus's ""problem"" is many orders of magnitude larger.  And it lacks the hydrogen necessary to form water, most of having been blown away by solar winds over the eons due to a lack of a magnetosphere (i's rotation is slow, 243 days and that lack of rotation means weak magnetic field generation).

So 90 atmospheres of pressure at ground level, 97% CO2, absence of necessary element and inability to keep it even if a way was found to introduce it, and a too-slowly-rotating planet to support earth-like life.

So it's unlikely...  ",0,,,15,science

>The extreme detour of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, about 4.6 metres (15 ft) in the case of giraffes,[26]:74–75 is cited as evidence of evolution, as opposed to Intelligent Design. The nerve's route would have been direct in the fish-like ancestors of modern tetrapods, traveling from the brain, past the heart, to the gills (as it does in modern fish). Over the course of evolution, as the neck extended and the heart became lower in the body, the laryngeal nerve was caught on the wrong side of the heart.

aca4z3,2,"This. The cause was the evolution of an enzyme called lignin, which at the time was too tough for any microbe to break down. Lignin is also the enzyme responsible for trees being hard, and the end result was that trees would grow (or more specifically, tree-like ferns or proto-trees. A lot of the other features we think of as signature to ""trees"" had yet to develop, such as a hardened bark, waxy leaves, or pinecones), die, and their bodies would be left on the ground, largely incapable of rotting. As the primary component by mass of such foliage was carbon, the effect of such plants en masse was to convert a much higher than average portion of the atmosphere to oxygen (from carbon dioxide) than has ever before or since been seen (for reference, oxygen peaked at around 35-40% of the atmosphere, compared to today's 20%). Oxygen is highly reactive (that's why it's useful for biological & industrial processes alike), and eventually combined with other gases and detritus on the ground (or was sucked into the ocean). Those proto-tree trunks were buried, and became the bulk of fossil fuel stocks we use today (hence the term carboniferous period, initially named after the presence of high carbon-concentration black rocks, coal).

Plants never ""overpopulated"" (it's difficult to find a general use for that term that doesn't impose some kind of bias), they evolved to more efficiently fight off their parasites (yes, herbivores are parasites not predators). This kind of evolution has actually happened twice since then, first with the evolution of flowers (which allows plants to spread much, much faster than they might have otherwise) and more recently with the evolution of grass (which is actually two separate steps, the use of the 25% more efficient C4 photosynthesis, as compared to C3 seen in all non-grasses; and the evolution of silica 'blades' on the cell walls of grasses. These blades shred microorganisms, and make it much more energy intensive to digest grasses (silica is essentially glass). Grasses are so efficient, they destroyed much of the great forests outside of the arctic & antarctic. We're very, very lucky ruminants (cows & such. They use a multichambered stomach which ferments consumed grass to separate the silica from the nutritional elements. It's a highly inefficient process, hence why manure is still so rich in nutrients) evolved, without them we'd still just be apes).",0,,,10,science

This does not improve carbon fixation. Rubisco continues to grab Oxygen on accident at the same rate as before. But the ATP and NADPH are not used up as quickly with the shortcut engineered into these plants. That means that they have more energy to turn into biomass!

aca4z3,0,"Finding shortcuts around photorespiration may be one crucial step for enhancing agriculture in the near future but we have many more steps to go. Increasing biomass is one thing, but translating that to enhanced crop yield is another. There arent many plants we grow that contribute significantly to our caloric diets through vegitative biomass alone (you vant feed the world on kale and cabbage). 

In order to make significant gains and establish food security in developing countries (namely Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America) we need things that not only grow larger, but handle stresses better. Our deserts are expanding, heat waves are becoming hotter and more severe. New plant diseases are emerging every decade. Soil microbial communities are neigh obliterated with modern tilling and fertilizer practices. We need a concerted effort in all of these areas if we are to simply maintain human population levels in the future, let alone feed a population near double that size in 2100.

Long story short, fund more plant research!",0,,,1,science

aca4z3,0,"Does this matter?  For global agriculture, I mean, not just for being very cool.

My understanding is that modern crop yields are primarily limited by the availability of water and fertilizer.  Faster/bigger growth requires more of both.  So you can grow more on a given acre of land but you have to apply a proportionally larger amount of irrigation and nutrients, which are already the (very expensive) limiting factors.

Am I wrong on this?",0,,,1,science

aca4z3,0,"Serious question:

In history - as in the past - flora was known to grow VERY VERY BIG. If you look at the recent past, when say humans populated Appalachia in North America - you can see that trees were GIGANTIC. And humans would cut these down to make homes, streets, etc.

This photosynthetic glitch - is this something caused by humans? Plants (like trees) are not growing to those insane sizes in comparable amounts of time - so I am wondering how humans effected this (if at all) and if this photorespiratory shortcut is just replacing what this flora once had which will enable them to grow to giant sizes again?",0,,,1,science

aca4z3,0,"That's pretty brilliant right there. No need for traditional agriculture anymore! On top of it correcting how plants work, it'd be process more CO2 from the atmosphere! Imagine doing this for algae, trees... everything we've already damaged, not just the crops. Why didn't they test this on a couple of different plants to see if this effect varies? Oh man, you can even do this for desert areas to rebuild habitats/ use the land.",0,,,1,science
