2mujav,0,"Hey guys, I am the lead-author of this paper and would be happy to answer any questions, or do an AMA if there's enough interest.

Josh",0,,,23,science
2mujav,1,If you message the mods and give us some proof of who you are we can highlight you as the author. That way users know you're who you say you are and that you're answering questions.,0,,,4,science
2mujav,1,"Could you share more details about the full model that provided the 25% figure? i.e. adjusted r^2, F statistic, p value, and list of covariates. 
",0,,,2,science
2mujav,2,"Sure. The 17-25% statistic is based on a comparison to another study (Graven et al., 2013 Science) that used inverse modeling to estimate the total additional seasonal carbon exchange necessary to replicate the observed patterns of atmospheric CO2. Our work estimated the annual increase in seasonal carbon exchange just from four crops (maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans) using a carbon accounting model of our own design. That model provided the additional carbon exchange and associated uncertainty, calculated via a Monte Carlo approach reflecting parameter uncertainty. 

Happy to provide additional details if you like. While we didn't seek to simultaneously estimate the contribution from other sources, another independent effort in the same issue (Zeng et al) answered the same question using a process-model. They found that agricultural changes probably are responsible for 45% of the total enhanced seasonality. The differences between our studies are mostly due to the fact that Zeng and colleagues considered total ag production for the entire globe, while we looked specifically at maize, wheat, rice and soybeans in the Northern Hemisphere's extratropical lands. It's encouraging that two different methodologies arrive at the same conclusion: increases in cropland productivity play a substantial role in increasing atmospheric CO2 seasonality.",0,,,2,science
2mujav,1,"Have you compared the carbon emissions effects of monoculture vs polyculture? From what I've read, small scale polyculture produces overall higher yields per acre than monocultures, but I honestly don't know much about farming staples on an industrial scale. It seems like the study focuses on American farming, which (I think) was already very heavily monocultured by 1961. I would be very curious to see how this ""breathing"" has changed globally since 1961, as monoculture has become more popular internationally since the Green Revolution. And has the study looked at all at the effects of chemical fertilizers on these emissions ""breaths""? (Considering the way that such fertilizers run off with the rain rather than trapping carbon in the soil, and thus contribute to soil that is overall less nutrient-rich); I'm also curious about how industrial monoculture, especially the use of herbicides, might have affected the process of wild plants growing in cultivated fields (which would presumably affect this process?) ",0,,,2,science
2mujav,2,"These are all great and interesting questions. We did not compare carbon storage/release in monocultures vs. polycultures. We started at production numbers and made our way to total carbon taken out of the atmosphere. In this regard, it doesn't really matter how it was accomplished, just that more carbon was removed/released to the atmosphere because we produced more food on the same land. Now, the reason it doesn't really matter is because the emissions associated with farming (running tractors, making nitrogen, pumping water, etc.) just don't have a strong seasonality. These farming practices are large contributors to the overall growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere, but these emissions are fairly constant throughout the year. Therefore, they don't impact the ""depth of the biosphere's carbon breath"" very much. Another potential difference among cropping systems is the amount of carbon that remains in the soil for the long-term. While practices such as no-till may (and I emphasize ""may"" here) lead to more carbon stored long-term in the soil, it's a very small amount (maybe 2-4% of annual NPP) and so likewise doesn't strongly affect the annual seasonality. Of course, if you store 2% over a large land area for a long time, it can help mitigate emissions, it just won't affect the seasonal exchange of carbon very much.

Certainly fertilizers and chemical weed/pest management is a big part of how these croplands have managed to become so much more productive over the last fifty years, and your'e absolutely right to point out the long-term effects this may have on soil nutrients as well as water quality. That was not a part of our study, although it does receive quite a bit of research attention.",0,,,4,science

2mujav,3,"Just the meat industry alone is a bigger contributor to global warming than the entire transport sector (all cars/planes/boats/trains/what have you combined). Mind you, this is not only due to carbon dioxide but also methane. At least based on reports from the U.N.",0,,,12,science
2mujav,4,"This phenomenon is a bit more complicated than such reports suggest. First because animals release carbon that is already in the carbon cycle (carbon they harvest from plants and then turn into farts etc, vs coal and oil, which, previous to burning, were not part of the cycle). Second because herd animals are a critical part of keeping water in the soil in plains ecosystems, which thereby reduces desertification, which thereby helps plants grow in those ecosystems, which thereby reduces the CO2 in the atmosphere because plants are growing there. But an overabundance of herd animals, especially when raised unsustainably, can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions",0,,,7,science

2mujav,6,"that might be the case, but I don't believe so. I'm pretty sure that housing and killing animals is relatively light on fossil fuels as compared to running a tractor over 1000 acres of land... the reason that animals create high emissions is that you have to take up a lot of land to produce a relatively small number of calories--land that might otherwise be occupied by forests--and the animals themselves are converting carbon trapped in plants into carbon that can be released into the atmosphere",0,,,1,science

This improved understanding should help us better understand what role natural ecosystems are playing as well, and therefore have improved projections of the global carbon cycle and its linkage with the climate system.

I think you're asking about climate change and overall environmental ""goodness"", though. What we've found is that ecosystems occupying a very small footprint have a really outsized impact on the carbon cycle because of intensive management seeking to optimize productivity. While this alters the seasonal course of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the year-on-year increase in annual average concentrations driven by emissions is MUCH bigger and has a MUCH larger effect on climate. However, the increased seasonal carbon exchange is being driven by farming practices that themselves are very energy intensive, and so are a very substantial source of emissions themselves.

Correct so far. And most of this CO2 release already happens during the composting process:

> Composting is the natural biological breakdown of organic material into a more stable organic substance. During the process of aerobic composting (presence of oxygen), microorganisms consume organic matter (carbon) and release heat and carbon dioxide (CO2 )  
([source](http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/cl3014))

organic matter is emitted as CO2** (Beck‐Friis et al., 2000).

Down the line, compost is further decomposes into humus.

You're correct (and I stand corrected) insofar as *some* carbon actually stays in the soil:

That's really interesting because it indicates that there have been some large scale changes in the way the biosphere operates, but this seasonal ""wiggle"" in CO2 concentrations is dwarfed by the overall rise in annual average concentrations, and that is what should have the largest climate impact.

Yes, we irrigate, which increases biomass over historical trend, but most yield increase has come not form more standing biomass but better partitioning of dry matter into the seed. For example, 'unimproved strains of maize get about a fifth of their dry matter into seed, but modern hybrids put nearly two thirds into them. 

What's missing is the stimulus to natural plant life. Carbon dioxide is of course a fertiliser - strictly, it makes available water go further - but human activity also causes nitrogen salts, sulphur and other micronutrients to rain down on wild plants. Lightning fixes about 10 MT of nitrates per annum, combustion by humans is guessed at as being 300MT or more. ",0,,,4,science
2mujav,1,"We don't attribute it entirely to farming. Instead, we say that four crops alone (maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans) probably account for 17-25% of the increased seasonality, or ""deeper breath"" of the biosphere. This excludes over 30% of the dry biomass production in the extra tropics, so the impact of all croplands is likely much higher.

Your point about changes in partitioning of carbon is well made, and this is something that we looked at. However, our meta-analysis of published measurements of harvest indices and root:shoot ratios (details in the Methods) found no significant change in these quantities over the time period of interest (since 1960). Since we know that things like dwarfed-wheat/rice exists, this is somewhat puzzling. The most likely explanation is that uptake of improved varieties of these crops happened prior to 1960 within our study region. Unfortunately, the data to verify this and/or include these effects in the model aren't available. So, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that quantified the effect of allowing harvest indices to increase over time. It turns out that it leads to a very small reduction (2%) of our estimate. This is primarily because corn is the major drive of the signal, and unlike wheat and rice, there are no dwarfed or otherwise largely modified corn varieties.

I'm not sure about your comment on ""stimulus to natural plant life"", but there is, of course, a HUGE environmental impact associated with these production increases. Global ag accounts for around 25% of GHG emissions, for example.",0,,,8,science

So, their r-squared is 0.25? In my field that would not be an impressive finding at all. Is it different in climate science?

\* okay this is almost certainly a partial r-squared, so it really should be interpreted in light of the total adjusted r-squared of the regression model, it's F statistic, and p-value. None of these are given in the abstract, so it's not possible to assess without the full text. ",0,,,3,science
2mujav,2,"No, that quarter isn't their confidence level. It's the proportion of the human-agriculture-caused component to the overall-vegetation total.

That 27.2% is an r-squared (or, more specifically a partial r^2 if a multivariate model). Compare it to this stats class interpretation of r-squared:

2mujav,0,"Whenever I read about climate change and such, it always leads me back to population control and how it shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing. I feel like all data is just pointing its finger at the option, but no one wants to introduce the idea for fear of being labelled something not very good. I'm not talking about killing people obviously, but incentives such as tax breaks for couples without children for example. 

Here in the US its actually opposite, the more kids you have the more money you get. I understand why that is, you can't let children starve, but why not more of an incentive to NOT have children. or to have less children? ",0,,,1,science
2mujav,1,"I disagree. 

The average cost for raising a child is 250k now. As a result, more and more young people are becoming ""childfree"" so that they can enjoy their money. 

It seems to be a growing trend. but its one of those wait and see things that may become a potential problem. ",0,,,3,science
2mujav,2,"I agree on the saving money by not having a child. Where I come from (southern Ohio) people have children and use them as a source of income through child support and welfare, even getting low income housing out of the deal. I call it ""child farming"" and its a big issue that no one seems to talk about because they fear being labelled as insensitive to the lower class. These people bring lives into the world they know they can not take care of, and when the child grows up, the cycle appears to continue with them. 

I was one of those kids and I do work and I moved away, so I know not EVERY child will end up doing this, but for the most part they will. So I feel a lot of our population are ,for lack of a better way of putting it, ""these people"". There needs to be some sort of incentives for these lower class individuals to not produce 3-4 children on average. Just an FYI, I'm still lower class and assume I always will be haha.",0,,,3,science
2mujav,3,"Yeah, that is one of the problems with the welfare system. But that is a political hot button topic right there. 

Heaven forbid we have a program that encourages poor people to put off having children until they are more financially stable.  One half of the political spectrum will scream socialism, and the other will scream eugenics. 

I hate it so much. Its a clear flaw in a system. the system in theory, is to help people get more stable. This flaw, inadvertently encourages them to be more dependent on the system. 

BUT, I have noticed that a lot of people that do grow up like that, understand how expensive kids are, and i suspect that may be part of this new child free movement.
