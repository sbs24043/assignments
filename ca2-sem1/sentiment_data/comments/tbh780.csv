tbh780,2,"It doesn't currently. 85% of food consumed in Africa is imported. Food underproduction in Africa is reflected in both the current map (some very-low-density land with <10% covered) and the optimal-within-borders map, which keeps the same level of production.

Why is this? Mostly, agriculture in Africa is dominated by high-value, labour-intensive crops like cocoa, coffee, tea and cotton for export to richer countries. In turn, African nations import the cheap, mechanically-farmed staples that everyone eats, mostly from Brazil, France and India. This arrangement takes advantage of global income inequality to keep prices low on non-staple crops, but it is logistically inefficient, exploitative, threatens African food security, and is environmentally damaging.

Compare the two ""optimal"" scenarios. The optimal-within-borders map shows as much agricultural production in Africa as there is today, just concentrated in a few efficient high-density pockets with mechanisation. The optimal-across-borders map has much more green in Africa, and so the African continent as a whole would likely become a net exporter of food while simultaneously tackling climate change and improving worldwide food security in the face of it.

However, this transformation would require four things:

1. Huge and carefully administrated investment in agricultural mechanisation and transit across tropical Africa
2. Restructuring of land ownership and land use to farm in high-density pockets that favour mechanisation
3. Ending the decades-long civil war in the Central African Republic at least, which you'll note from the map is the optimal site for a huge percentage of world agriculture but currently supports essentially none

One of the plans I had seen was a bit in another direction in that they wanted food production and processing to be more local or regionalized to reduce transportation costs.    

The food processing is not a simple thing, when you do at large scale. Those facilities would have to moved and powered by something or there are a lot of transportation costs. Most food processing facilities are located near food production sites today.  For me I would like to see more discussion that includes  after the plant product is harvested how transportation and processing of food for consumption will work.  (there will still be a need for soup in cans, frozen meals etc.) If they do get a more plant based diet to become popular then alot of this will change because so much grown is for livestock. They pushed off the discussion on livestock which, based on at least todays diet, a rather large part of this.

Its like electric cars or ethanal in gasoline. When you look at where in the world all the materials in the world need to come from to build the car or the energy needed for growing the corn it doesn't get the savings you hoped for.

But there are two big issues with centralizing food production. One has been mentioned here, which is transportation costs increase, which as it stands now is one of the leading sources of carbon impact. The opposite trend, of distributing and localizing food production has been gaining traction as a green initiative for this reason.

The other and I think more dangerous issue is that by centralizing food production you reduce the resilience and redundancy distribution gives you. I.e a bad localized drought can decimate food production - something which is going to become a lot more likely as the climate changes.",0,,,3,science

We don't get something for nothing.

Also having such largely concentrated farming puts the food supply at greater risk for diseases or weather causing significant food disruptions, to say nothing of issues of equity and control of the food supply.
