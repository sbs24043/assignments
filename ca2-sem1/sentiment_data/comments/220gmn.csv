220gmn,1,"As you move poleward growing seasons are shorter, solar insolation is more diffuse towards the poles, and the soil is often not conducive to growing crops.  So unfortunately it won't be as simple as moving crop production closer to the poles to avoid the hotter lower latitudes. ",0,,,1,science

220gmn,3,My opinion is that what WG3 proposes is going to be the most informed options as they are devoting far more time and manpower to the issue than I can.  I defer to the experts when expertise is warranted as it is now.,0,,,8,science
220gmn,4,"So you are in favor of GMO crops then I assume. 

",0,,,-4,science
220gmn,1,GMO has not had any effect on overall productivity. All productivity improvements have been gained through conventional hybridization and breeding. There is no reason to assume that GMO will come to the rescue.,0,,,2,science
220gmn,2,"It depends honestly, IR crops have shown meaningful increases to yields by mitigating loss of crops do to pest. There is also some work with GM rice that shows a significant increase in yields in very early studies. ",0,,,5,science
220gmn,2,"Are you aware how ""conventional"" breeding is? You understand to speed up the process they irradiate seeds to promote genetic mutations. they have been doing this for the last 100 or so years. Just about every food crop is the result of a encourages but uncontrolled mutation. 

Please Educate yourself on the benefits of GMO's and the fact that there is no real science behind the anti GMO movement. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/on-hawaii-a-lonely-quest-for-facts-about-gmos.html?_r=0

Please address the above article in reference to NON scientific based experts being relied upon for ""evidence"" 

And here is a bit for Scientific American on Drought resistant GMO's http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/corn-genetically-modified-to-tolerate-drought/

And please comment on the above with respect to drought resistant GMO's

By the way MIT says your statment if False. 
[quote]GMO crops have been found to increase yields, with a 10 percent change to a genetically modified herbicide tolerant crop yielding a roughly 1.7 percent increase in productivity (USDA). Biotechnology companies state that such varieties of crops will improve the livelihood of farmers around the world (Cummins).[/quote]

220gmn,3,Making a crop pesticide resistant has nothing to do with productivity.,0,,,0,science
220gmn,4,"No crops are made pesticide resistant. You dont need to do that. Why would you think something like that???

If you understood how GMO's work they are engineered to be resistant to Herbicides, or to produce a natural pesticide. 
Herbicides Kill plants, pesticides kill insects. The reason is so that when you spray a Herbicide on the field only the crop is left, less competition for sun,water, and nutrients.... (shaking my head slowly at the lack of understanding of the issues)",0,,,-3,science
220gmn,5,"An herbicide is technically a pesticide

 >The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer.[2]

220gmn,5,OK I meant herbicide.,0,,,0,science
220gmn,6,"Then why didnt you say herbicide, because making plants herbicide resistant increases productivity of a crop, increases yield, that the the conclusion of the study from MIT I linked to. Where is your scientific data to back up your statement, no blogs or opinion based articles, hard fast scientific data with a direct causation. 
the reason I ask is that by saying ""GMO crops dont increase crop productivity"" you are saying MIT has published false data???? Is that what you are saying?",0,,,0,science
