16sy4kk,0,"Take your average yield and then figure out what price you can sell the grain for, then add up all your costs including time, if you can get historic yield data from the previous farmer it would help with the financial planning, then figure out what the lowest yield possible is and build from there being careful to not go broke if your yield is impacted negatively, need a way to have steady cash flow so maybe some on farm storage is necessary, also try and learn as much agronomy as you can so you can ensure everything is done right to ensure maximum yields",0,,,15,farming
16sy4kk,1,Awesome thank you! I absolutely will take that advice. I know that’s not near enough land to go full-time farming or anything so I will definitely keep my day job we currently get 235 acre cash rent but I figure if I started doing the hardest thing myself we could make a good bit more than that,0,,,5,farming
16sy4kk,0,"Native Ohioan here, and did research in your area. Rent it for another year. You need to get a lot more ducks in a row, here.

Do you have any experience at all? Honestly, at that scale, I’d be investing that $150K.",0,,,9,farming
16sy4kk,1,"Yeah, this is just a someday plan! I am in my early 20s, I’ve worked ground and ran an auger cart for a buddy who’s a farmer but that’s the limit of my experience. I have a few rentals and other investments and right now the 150 is in a money market account at 5 1/2% interest and due to farmland and other assets. I will be adding to it multiple times a year. I would eventually like to buy more land but with the price of farmland, I might continue investing in housing real estate instead",0,,,5,farming

16sy4kk,0,Just keep renting it. It's not worth the hassle.,0,,,22,farming
16sy4kk,1,"I’ve been told that as well, I’ve been told if it was 800 to 1000 acres it would be worth it and I could do that full-time. I’ve just always been super interested in farming I would be doing more it for hobby/fun as compared to trying to make a living",0,,,11,farming
16sy4kk,2,What you should consider is approaching the folks that currently rent the land and say you are interested in learning and see if you can be involved for a season or two. That way you can see everything involved before you get in over your head.,0,,,12,farming
16sy4kk,2,"You could consider start by trialing a niche a CSA box on a small scale with a couple of acres and renting out the remainder for cash crops as usual. 

You could do really well if you could grow veg or fruit in a heated greenhouse and undercut the big boys at a local level. 

Low-overhead, value-added products marketed as “support local” are where it’s at (pickling, preserves with unique spices or fruit combinations, hot sauces).",0,,,7,farming
16sy4kk,2,"I think it's worth doing. The sucky part is getting the equipment aquired. If you got the ambition and desire, you can take that 350 and expand apon it and grow your operation. To me, it's answsome opportunity if you take full advantage of it.",0,,,3,farming
16sy4kk,3,"I definitely agree, the only barrier with that is price of farmland but I know I have a pretty good start compared to others, at one point we had a half a million line of credit on that 43 acre farm so I could get a pretty good size line against all the land and start acquiring farmland",0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,2,You’ll hear that a lot from the current tenants lol. They say it as a way to look out for themselves so they can keep farming 350 acres. Btw are your siblings on board or do they express interest in selling out?,0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,3,"Yeah I do feel bad about the current farmers potentially losing it, they have farmed it since 2000. however I feel the were taking advantage of my grandfather. We inherited it last fall and he was only getting $165 an acre, just through word of mouth people heard of us acquiring it and were making offers for rent. When we went to them they instantly offered 235 an acre with overrides on crop yields. My siblings have no interest in selling out, my little brother has his own business and is extremely successful and busy with that, if anything my sister has interest in potentially leveraging the land to grow her real estate portfolio but not currently due to the state of the housing market",0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,4,The highest cash rent person isn’t always the best. They can sometimes pose the most risk to not pay due to getting themselves in financial trouble and they are most likely to deplete the lime and fertilizer levels without replenishing them especially if they are on a 2 year type contract. But $165 vs $235 does seem like a really large difference I agree. Depending on the field some might even say $235 is low but the flex aspect makes it a little more appealing. The bottom line is that it sucks farming for landlords. Mainly because farming competitors are pesky little greedy bastards and it just gives the landlord so much leverage. It’s much better farming family owned ground and not having to worry about all that bush league shit.,0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,"The biggest issue you will run into is equipment starting out. Ideally you would need a tractor, planter, tillage equipment, combine, sprayer, grain truck and grain storage. It sounds like you have the general knowledge but you would need some help from your friend on the business & agronomy side. Starting out you could buy a tractor, planter, tillage tool and talk your friend and work out a deal to spray & harvest the crop and whatever you have left over you reinvest into the operation. You would have to set out a deal with your family because I'm assuming the cash rent is split so you would have to factor that dynamic in as well. But I would not use that money to make big purchases starting out. Depending on where you are at in Ohio you could double crop beans & winter wheat and rotate to corn to help cash flow. But I would say go for it if you have someone to mentor you and help you out.",0,,,5,farming
16sy4kk,1,"Thank you very much for your input. I appreciate it! The land is in Marion/Hardin/wyandot counties. I used to see a lot of winter wheat growing up, but not so much anymore, I have thought about that and have talked with my buddy about either him planting/fertilizing for me or I were to getting a combine first or shelling/cutting for me if I got the tractor and planter first. The farmers we currently have do no till I don’t personally like it I know, my buddy who farms thinks it is really bad for the soil as far as compaction as far as splitting, you are correct we do currently split the cash rent, but both of my siblings are very well established financially, and I am sure would help me out, all of the land is owned, free and clear so I have also thought about going to the bank with that as collateral and potentially purchasing all the equipment at once. I would buy smaller used equipment at first but I just wanted some opinions first.",0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,2,"I farm with my great uncle in western ND so we have a short growing season so you are right on the border of being able to double crop, you are in corn & bean country and wheat is normally not as profitable. No till has its uses depending on erosion & soil type, we have to use no till extensively because of inconsistent rainfall and super sandy soil. To start out you would probably be better with a tractor & planter because you would end up using the tractor way more than a combine. Corn is logistically tough to deal with especially if you have to dry it because or you will be paying for drying at the elevator. If you get along with your siblings it is not an issue but its not a bad idea to have a contract in place. Financially it sounds like you are in a great place so you should not have issues with lending, for a tractor I would recommend a fwd john deere 4450 or 4650 so you could plant and be able to do tillage without an issue. It sounds like you have a great opportunity to get started and see if you like it and want to keep doing it.",0,,,3,farming
16sy4kk,0,"Write a business plan using online templates at a bare minimum.  Look at some enterprise budgets for the crops you propose to raise.  Grow the crop for real on paper and see if you like the results.  Don’t use best case scenarios.  Assume average yields, average prices, and above average expenses when evaluating.  If you can grow the crop on your kitchen table you will know how to proceed.",0,,,3,farming
16sy4kk,1,That is great advice! Thank you very much I will do that,0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,0,Hell you're not far from me. I'm on the marion/ morrow line. I'd rent it out for a few more years. Save the money and buy equipment and prepare and educate yourself to take it on yourself,0,,,3,farming
16sy4kk,1,"Nice! So my land is on the very far west edge of Marion County in fact, right on the Marion/hardin line. We have 43 acres in Marion County and then the field next to it is 160 but it’s in hardin. Yes sir that’s the game plan! Start slow I’ll probably buy a combine first I have a buddy that’s willing to plant corn in the spring for me and dress the field when needed as well as spray, and then I would harvest it in the fall. He’s also willing to let me use his trucks for grain transportation.",0,,,1,farming

16sy4kk,0,"For that small of a farm, don't buy a combine. There are always custom cutters available. And just a tractor and a planter won't cover your operations. Depending on how you may farm, you could also need a plow or disc, maybe a harrow or a cultivator. All of the equipment needs maintenance. If you are covering your nut and maybe making some extra on the top, keep on renting it.",0,,,3,farming
16sy4kk,1,Thank you. This is the kind of advice I was looking for,0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,If you rent it out to a local neighbor and is in good standings with him maybe you could ask him if you could help him by driving tractors and combining,0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,"Something you might consider if you don't end up farming it yourself, you could rent it to someone on 50/50 crop share lease. You would be responsible for half the crop inputs and in return you get half of the crop in the fall. You could learn to market grain, manage inputs, and gain agronomy knowledge.",0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,1,"That’s a great idea! So right now I think we have a great lease, we rent it for 235 an acre but if it averages over 65 bushel an acre on beans or 185 on corn we get 50% of the market value of crop per acre",0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,With those assets you should have a lot of collateral to get some good equipment to get the job done. You can also afford to make mistakes and not have the best crops for awhile. Happy farming.,0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,Rent it until you gain a little more cash then buy older equipment out right and start.  You will be miles ahead doing that.,0,,,2,farming
16sy4kk,0,"Grow grass, make hay, raise beef. You won’t need a half million dollar tractor. Or a $250,000 barn to put it in or $15,000 worth of diesel fuel every year or I don’t know how much in fertilizer, herbicide, fungicide, insecticide and seeds.

Have the land tilled and seeded for pasture, fence it let it grow a summer and put cows on it. You visit the cows on the weekend to make sure that they’re not dead and they have water. Get yourself some hay making equipment and bale hay on a portion the land every year (or hire it out) so you have some winter feed and you’re in business. I’m sure someone has failed at it, but I’ve never met anyone who had access to cheap land that couldn’t make money on grass fed beef and inherited land is the cheapest kind of land there is.",0,,,2,farming

16sy4kk,0,"Don't quit your day job. That $150k probably won't even cover seed and fertilizer, especially if you're planting all corn.  

You'll need to talk to your siblings, and probably a lawyer, about a long term land rental agreement even though you are a part owner. The trust will have to pay property taxes and your farming operation is going to have to cover that cost, and likely several other costs, through land rent.

Find some more experienced people in your area to learn from. I've been doing this my whole life and I learn something everyday, usually the hard way. Your county farm bureau is a great place to start building your network. You'll find better advice from them than strangers on the internet. 

Running the equipment is easy (some days anyway).The hard part is the business side. Successful farmers are business men and women first, and their business is farming.

I checked your post history, and I'm not being judgmental here. You need to kick your drug habit if you haven't already. That's only going to get in the way.",0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,1,"Thank you for your reply! I appreciate you taking the time for the in depth response. Yeah I’m a union electrician now, I love my job I have no intentions of quitting my job, honestly I’ve just always loved farming/heavy equipment and thought If possible to increase profits and do something I enjoy it’s worth looking into. Also you’re absolutely correct about the habit but thank the good lord I just celebrated two years of sobriety September 13th. I still drink occasionally and socially but I had a little boy and turned my life around, decided I needed to be a man and a father he could look up to I got help and left the drugs behind. Young and dumb is an understatement, I’m ashamed to say but I thought my drug addiction was cool sadly. If I had the money I wasted on those I have no doubt I could buy the equipment needed in cash.",0,,,3,farming

I used to ride along with my grandpa is Farmers as a kid then in high school I befriended a Farmer started running auger cart for them in the fall, and then would work ground once we got the crops off, however, once I got out of high school and got a full-time job, I quit.

16sy4kk,0,"You’re young enough to make plenty of mistakes and survive the trials and since you have no experience in farming and a love for making the ground fertile I suggest you take an open minded approach and talk to Gabe Brown at Gabe@understandingag.com 
Send him an email and explain your situation just as you have here, in fact you could just about copy n paste your post I think and he’s the man who can best set you in line for future profits. Let the renters continue this next year and get your feet firmly planted in a good foundation and develop a plan for success. Gabe Brown took over for his in-laws in 1993 and had to totally start over 5 years later after 4  successive years of climatic tragedies, hail, flood, drought, and hail again.

I guarantee you’ll be well informed to make proper decisions to move you into the future of agriculture. You are uniquely poised to do something that none of your predecessors could do. You’re so lucky and I would trade places with you in a heartbeat. I wish you nothing but the best and I do hope you’ll come back and tell us about your journey.
Regenerative farming is definitely the way to go to make profits while helping the environment. I do hope you reach out and learn about it before you start buying equipment. Good luck and best wishes.",0,,,1,farming
16sy4kk,0,"Keep working a 9-5 and learn to farm part time, at least while you're getting started. Try to work with your renter and see if they'll teach you. With 350 acres paid for ground and a sizable amount of start up cash, you're in a better position than many farmers already.

I would say maybe in spring of 2025 once you've learned some things, maybe plant 100 acres of corn for yourself. You could buy a used 100 horsepower tractor and a used 6 row planter to get started. Then work with a local spray outfit or pest scout company to show you what weeds, insects, and fungi to spray for. If you're ambitious you could spray it yourself or you could hire it out. Lastly I would hire out your harvesting at least the first couple years while you're still learning.

The older the better with farming equipment, especially nowadays when the new stuff is all electronic. One things goes down the whole thing goes down, and here’s the kicker… you can’t even fix it yourself. You have to get a technician from one of the companies to come fix it. They’ve purposely made these newer vehicles unfixable without high dollar equipment. If there isn’t any equipment, aim for older models when youre looking to buy. It’ll make it easier on you with fixing them up and the initial cost.",0,,,1,farming
