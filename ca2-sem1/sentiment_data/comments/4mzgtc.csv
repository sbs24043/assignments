4mzgtc,1,"*for once

Pretty much the only commercial use for GMO plants right now is to make them resistant to herbicides and then just flood the whole field with it so nothing but that GMO plant survives. I wouldn't call that ""good"", but maybe you have a different opinion, which is fine.",0,,,-5,science
4mzgtc,2,That's simply not true. Yield has always been a tremendous aspect of GM.,0,,,6,science
4mzgtc,3,"That's absolutely true. Yield increases, meanwhile the fields are drowning in Roundup made by Monsanto, and nature pays the price for that yield increase. Also the farmers who have to buy expensive seeds because Monsanto made sure to sterilize all their seeds.

GMO could maybe be used for good things. It's not though, it actually made everything worse.",0,,,-7,science
4mzgtc,4,"Several herbicides are used on crops that are resistant to them. Some are GMO and some aren't. 

Some were developed to have a resistance to a specific herbicide, and there's many herbicides that are species specific.

4mzgtc,2,"No matter what the crop is, nutrients are taken up into crop products, and those products plus the nutrients they took up from the soil leave. 

A lot of farmland in production never had optimum levels of certain essential nutrients, so they're added. http://www.soils.wisc.edu/extension/pubs/A2522.pdf",0,,,1,science
4mzgtc,3,Why not use crop rotation?,0,,,1,science
4mzgtc,4,"That's been a long time standard for a lot of farmers, but that doesn't do what Rodale Gardening makes people think it does for farmers. 

Even after soy, some other legume, or even after a cover crop, at least some nitrogen might need to be added to bring levels up to optimum for the next crop. 

Pretty standard to take lots of samples and send them off to a lab to see exactly what's needed. ",0,,,1,science
