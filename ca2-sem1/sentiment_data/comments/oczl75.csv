oczl75,0,"University agricultural scientist here. First, thanks for the summary article *actually* giving [a link](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0fa4) to the study itself so we can go read it instead of trying to do guesswork to hunt down a possible title.

> Here we empirically estimate the effect of four key pollutants (ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on maize and soybean yields in the United States . . .

Each of those pollutants make sense, but I'm really glad they included sulfur dioxide. There actually is discussion now about how some fields may not be getting enough sulfur now because we aren't getting as much acid rain as we used to and increased marketing to farmers saying buy more sulfur in your fertilizer mix. Some fields do need more sulfur, but there's also a lot of selling without good merit for the addition going on too. It's a bit of a complicated discussion to get into, but at least using this paper, it is a good lead-in to say that yields overall are actually increasing with decreasing SO2 levels to help pump the brakes a bit in sulfur-related discussions.",0,,,226,science

It varies by condition and crop, but we're really past a point where any C3 crops would significantly benefit from any additional CO2.

oczl75,3,"> It’s way better for the environment and more efficient to use land to grow food directly for humans as opposed to livestock feed.

Generally no. Especially when it comes to grasslands, plowing that up for row crops instead is getting rid of a great carbon sink, releasing CO2, and often increasing runoff due to the often poorer or susceptible soil types in those biomes. Grazing it, especially when it like wide areas of the Unites States where that grassland is historically natural (unlike what's going on in the Amazon), is by far usually the best option in terms of food production efficiency. Especially considering that most beef cattle in the US spend the majority of their life on pasture, that's a pretty significant factor in play. Then you have to factor in other things like how we often use alfalfa in row crop rotations where that crop itself is going for livestock feed, but that crop being planted for multiple years fixes nitrogen instead of needing to add fossil-fuel based fertilizer and also breaks weed seed cycles to help avoid problems with herbicide use.

Then you get into row crops themselves. Some like wheat are largely direct to human use, but they have a limited market, and it's difficult to make a living if at all just growing wheat. Other crops, like corn and soybeans, are multiuse. Often times we extract our human uses first (food, oils, fuel, etc.), and then the livestock get the leftovers. They're also eating the parts of the plants we cannot use like leaf tissue, stems, etc. When you total all that up it basically amounts to [about 86% of the things livestock eat don't compete with human use.](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html)

So for us university educators, it's extremely common for this conversation to head towards some map a newspaper put out saying X acres go towards livestock without partitioning out things like pasture, multiple uses of crops, etc. vs often risker crops like fruits and vegetables that are normally direct to human use. Grains and livestock instead, tend to be multi-purpose and part of a very complex network that is easily overlooked that can't be easily partitioned into such an oversimplified map.",0,,,23,science

University agricultural scientist here. This is pretty misleading and part of very old misconceptions about what agricultural subsidies are even used for. You can go right here to learn about [the main ones: ARC and PLC](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/arcplc_program/index). You basically only have two main supports that kick in as a farmer in the US, and you can only elect to be [in one of the programs.](https://agecon.ca.uky.edu/arc-vs-plc-%E2%80%93-basics). 

Those basically boils down to crop insurance for if you have a major disaster like drought, hail, flooding, etc. or if the market drastically tanks.

So for major disasters, those tend not to be something for the most part out of our control. That form of crop insurance doesn't really give incentives to increase production, but buffers the other end of the spectrum when you would otherwise have a major crop loss year. 

The other is for major market drops. The trouble with this one is that many farmers do not see any payment out of this even when crop prices are below break even because it wasn't a large enough market drop. That program tends to only kick in when prices are really horrible rather than ""not so great"".

Beyond that, that's really the only main subsides farmers can get on the production end of things for field crops, and you are not making bank off either. Farmers are definitely not just getting regular checks simply for growing X acres of a certain crop or any easy handouts as often portrayed by those not familiar with farming.

> The majority of American corn is used for ethanol and livestock feed

That also gets to a bit of an apples to oranges comparison, usually because people often omit what actually goes into ethanol or livestock feed. Basically, [about 86% of the things livestock eat don't compete with human use.](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html) That's often because crops are multi-use. For something like ethanol, that corn is being used for both fuel and the remainder leftover from that process is used for livestock feed. Likewise, livestock mostly eat crop residue we have already extracted our use from, or simply cannot use well in the first place.

Climate change isn't making drought occur everywhere equally and/or in the same way. I think what you linked about Central America is certainly important to note. But globally, research suggests wetter places are getting wetter overall, dryer places are getting dryer overall, and precipitation rates aren't occuring as they have been traditionally (more rainfall at once, less often; less rainfall, more often; or a combination of all these unique patterns).  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161212084456.htm

While climate change continues to hurt current agricultural processes around the world, wealthy nations (like the USA with a vast wealth of different ag ecosystems and, also, actual monetary wealth [and the country that I specifically mentioned earlier]) will be able to adapt what is grown, how it is grown, and where it is grown to ensure an adequate nutrition supply for the country's population (it may be very different than the current diet). I truly believe food scarcity is not a realistic concern for the USA any time soon.

I argue that ctizens of wealthy nations should be mindful of food scarcity for poorer nations (like those in Central America) while spending their energy enacting more pressing legislation to ensure long term effects of climate change are diminished both domestically and globally.

oczl75,3,Ethanol is a joke. You get less mpg so you have to burn more. I'd like to see a study on whether it's less polluting that straight gas.,0,,,7,science
oczl75,4,"Well efficiency is a concern. However, ethanol isn't added to gasoline for carbon dioxide pollution. Gasoline is blended using a wide range of hydrocarbons with varying octane values. High octane gasoline is usually comprised of higher amounts of hydrocarbons that are more harmful to people. The obvious example here is benzene, a known carcinogen. There are also hydrocarbons with sulfur and nitrogen in them, which when burned produce compounds that cause acid rain. To combat this, the US has strict sulfur concentration requirements. To meet this, we use a process called hydrotreating that breaks the sulfur and nitrogen out of the hydrocarbons and makes for a cleaner product. A side effect of this is that you reduce the natural octane rating of the treated gasoline. To make up this octane loss, a clean, cheap, and easily produced additive was needed. At first this was the now notorious lead additive, but now we use ethanol. Ethanol increases octane ratings to the minimum required for you car engine while  allowing for intensive hydrotreating of the gasoline. It IS cleaner, by virtue of removing the need to add dirty or harmful compounds into the gasoline. As for efficiency, that's easy enough to calculate. The average BTU value of gas is 116,000 BTU per galine vs 76,300 for ethanol. 10% ethanol gives us .9x116 + .1x76.3 = 112.03. 112.03/116=.965. So ethanol gasoline is 96.5% as efficient with massive environmental benefits that are admittedly hard to quantify on my phone.  The benefits are geared towards pollution concerns outside of carbon dioxide. Some of which are actually much worse as greenhouse gases. Of course, a clean burning car will convert it to CO2 anyway.",0,,,13,science

I’ve never heard “big Ag” in my time spent in the agricultural industry. There will always big farmers, but no large corporations run agriculture like you might hear about pharmaceutical companies who are pulling the strings in the background. The Illinois farm bureau has 400k members alone. Agriculture supports 10.9% of the US workforce. 

U.S. agriculture has been subsidized for many years. I can’t say what would happen if the subsidies were gone, but a lot would probably change if the money wasn’t there. 

Also small gripe on your second source. It mentions the reasons for farm consolidation are not from economies of scale and etc. I’d like to mention the average new corn/soybean harvester costs around $300-500k, most people buy their homes for that amount. You can’t make any money off of 80 acres when corn is selling for $5 a bushel and you get 200 bushels an acre. You’re making 80k gross and still need to factor in seed and/or adding fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and lime. Not to mention a tractor and wagon to haul corn and a planter and cultivator for planting. Farming has a huge initial upfront cost and only makes sense when you’re farming lots of land. 54% of crop land is rented, meaning a farmer will rent land to grow crops. Lots of small farmers have given up and opted for leasing out their land. Or a wealthy individual will buy land and lease it out. Small farms (~400 acres and below) are too much work for the hassle. 

TL;DR Farming costs a lot upfront, and “big Ag” isn’t really a thing.

You are totally right about the price of harvesters. It's crazy high because companies like John Deere and IH know they can charge ridiculous prices, large farmers know they can finance ridiculous prices at rates that are backed by govt guarantees then do tax write offs on the equipment financing, and they then rent land at high prices to further justify buying the expensive equipment. This cycle contributes to ever higher land prices until only commodity crops for large-scale farmers make sense. Farmers that want to buy land and grow food for people are not easily able to because of big ag's market influence. 

I am way too tired to discuss the existence of big ag (the combined lobbying efforts of farm equipment manufacturers, seed genetic companies, ag insurers, processed food companies, etc). I urge you to research how modern processed food conglomerates rely on the insanely massive federal farm bill that is passed every five years.

>**Abstract:** Crop productivity is potentially affected by several air pollutants, although these are usually studied in isolation. A significant challenge to understanding the effects of multiple pollutants in many regions is the dearth of air quality data near agricultural fields. Here we empirically estimate the effect of four key pollutants (ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on maize and soybean yields in the United States using a combination of administrative data and satellite-derived yield estimates. We identify clear negative effects of exposure to O3, PM, and SO2 in both crops, using yields measured in the vicinity of monitoring stations. We also show that while stations measuring NO2 are too sparse to reliably estimate a yield effect, the strong gradient of NO2 concentrations near power plants allows us to more precisely estimate NO2 effects using satellite measured yield gradients. The presence of some powerplants that turn on and others that shut down during the study period are particularly useful for attributing yield gradients to pollution. We estimate that total yield losses from these pollutants averaged roughly 5% for both maize and soybean over the past two decades. While all four pollutants have statistically significant effects, PM and NO2 appear more damaging to crops at current levels than O3 and SO2. Finally, we find that the significant improvement in air quality since 1999 has halved the impact of poor air quality on major crops and contributed to yield increases that represent roughly 20% of overall yield gains over that period.",0,,,23,science

oczl75,1,"How pollutants affect maize and soybeans have been studied extensively for decades, so most people reading this article would already know, so to save on limited page space the  article's authors just put in citations for that. The four pollutants studied in this study are:

ozone (O3): ozone dissolves the water in plant leaves and kills cells, which reduces the rate of photosynthesis. More details from the USDA here: [https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/raleigh-nc/plant-science-research/docs/climate-changeair-quality-laboratory/ozone-effects-on-plants/](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/raleigh-nc/plant-science-research/docs/climate-changeair-quality-laboratory/ozone-effects-on-plants/) 

 particulate matter (PM): blocking light thereby reducing photosynthesis rate, plus harming farm workers (in the short term, coughing, phlegm, chest tightness, and breathlessness, and in the longer term, asthma, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function and other respiratory symptoms, heart attacks, and premature death) which diminishes productivity.

sulfur dioxide (SO2): induces leaves to lose water, reducing the rate of photosynthesis. Even worse effects when in combination with NO2 and ozone, not least by forming acid rain. More info: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643387909381667](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10643387909381667) 

nitrogen dioxide (NO2): low levels in the air can act as fertilizer, but at higher levels nitrite accumulates, plant cells acidify, and plants grow less or die. Plus it harms farm workers' respiration which diminishes productivity.

oczl75,0,"I work with a Ag professor from NC State and he said the higher yields from both soy and corn,  is from warmer ground temps occurring earlier and educating farmers on widely held beliefs about which is planted first, between the two.

oczl75,2,"I was talking globally, clearing land for animal feed is the leading cause of deforestation.

But yeah, South America currently have the highest rates of deforestation. 

Though I can’t see anything supporting your claim.

Last year 1.59 million ha of natural forest was lost in the US. Forest are being grown but the rate of decline still exceed the rate of rehabilitation.

75% of the US virgin forests are already gone.",0,,,-1,science
oczl75,3,"You shouldn't talk globally. Policies are local, by individual nations. And solutions are local. Lumping the complexities of every nation into one single global statistic is a fantastic way to manipulate data. 

You will see some slight forest loss here and there each year, as population increases and zoning expands. Losing 0.1% of forest cover in 20 years is remaining steady. There is also ample reforestation programs keeping up with it for the most part.",0,,,2,science
oczl75,4,"In regard to pollution reduction, policies aren’t just local, have you not heard of the Paris agreement? There is international cooperation on this issue because it very obviously is a global issue.

Agriculture (corn and soy crops) is factually the leading cause of deforestation in the US, as it is everywhere in the world. Timber isn’t in such a high demand that we’re tearing down virgin forests, it is specifically because of the demand for feeding a billion farm animals.",0,,,-1,science

oczl75,1,"Yes. There are yearly scientific conferences, grants, journals, and several fields of study just on the health effects of pollution. ""Environmental health"" is a big catch-all term, but there are others.   
The scientific community has been clear that industrial pollution has adverse health effects for over a hundred years.  In particular, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen dioxide cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease and death in humans like asthma, heart attacks, and infant mortality.  To your question about car exhaust: there's a very linear relationship between car exhaust and mortality, such that for every 10 µg/m3 increase in very fine particulate matter there's around a 3.4% increase in daily deaths. [https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/ehp.00108941](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/abs/10.1289/ehp.00108941) I linked one relatively recent study from the US, but there are hundreds of studies from different parts of the world you could find if you wanted (location and time matter because it matters exactly what that fine particulate matter is made of and what other pollutants are present).",0,,,2,science

Think about all the particles that got into the air and how that would have reflected sunlight.
