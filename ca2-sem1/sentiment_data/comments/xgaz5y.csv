xgaz5y,0,Big farmers didn’t get big by having bad crops every year.,0,,,26,farming
xgaz5y,0,"Im going to say it, fertilizer.

This whole debate is going on and meanwhile we're harvesting our wheat at high 50s bu/acre and thinking were doing pretty darn good.

Then you hear about 100+ bu/acre wheat and you also notice that you've never increased your nitrogen rates since the beginning of time. 

You also reckon that you do the same thing other farmers are doing with the same equipment and the same seed varieties... yet they're constantly out proformin you, in the exact same conditions.",0,,,19,farming
xgaz5y,1,"This is why in crop fertilizer treatments work so good. When I know I can push the crop I will take the sprayer across again with more fertilizer to get that yield gain. If it's a droughty year, gonna take the the sprayer less across with fertilizer.",0,,,2,farming
xgaz5y,0,"There are at least 10 different things affecting yield. Here are a few 

Fertilizer is a big one.  Being organic or not.  Quality of soil.  Quality of well water if used - a lot of wells are salty water which can hurt yield.  Bugs, mold.   Amount of irrigation vs crop need, especially in California 

One ranch may do well, another 15 miles away may do poorly just because the staff didn’t water for three days in the heat of summer. The regular guy was out sick and the replacement just forgot about one field!",0,,,15,farming
xgaz5y,0,"Farming practices, seed, organic/non-organic. There are a lot of different answers to this question and isn't really one correct answer",0,,,11,farming
xgaz5y,0,Field conditions during planting and the weather after planting play pretty big roles in what kind of stand of crops you end up with.,0,,,5,farming
xgaz5y,0,"Soil quality. Water. Fertilizer. Labor. Seed type. 

There’s a dozen things or more that could be answered here. The harder you work the luckier you get.",0,,,5,farming
xgaz5y,0,"Poor management. Be it fertilizer(60lbs of N isn't enough its not 1976 anymore), chemical, rotation. If you own the land you could have a lifetime of poor crops and be just fine. You'll fuck up the next guy though since that's just stagnation.",0,,,4,farming
xgaz5y,0,"Even on our farm I noticed one year our rye cover crop had terrible germination. Turns out after about 3 years you need some fresh certified seed, rather than using the previous years grain. Luckily we only ever use rye for cover crop, so it wasn't a big deal.",0,,,4,farming
xgaz5y,1,"If you have good season and you harvest on time there will be some genetic drift but the germ rate itself isn't really impacted by the number of generations your grow out. It's not like the foundational/certified growers are really doing anything to improve germ that you can't, they're just more hygenic about seedborne diseases and rogueing off types",0,,,2,farming
xgaz5y,0,Why are some people successful and some are not.  Comes down to yield goals and management.,0,,,3,farming
xgaz5y,0,Because Mother Nature. Not all ground is the same no matter how seemingly close it is to one another. There are a multitude of reasons.,0,,,2,farming
xgaz5y,0,If one spends $150/acre to make $200/acre and the neighbor spends $350/acre to make $390/acre whose the better farmer?,0,,,2,farming
xgaz5y,1,It just doesn’t work that way from what I’ve seen. Very rarely can you buy all the cheapest inputs and use the least amount of fertilizer/chemicals as possible and beat the competition in terms of profitability.,0,,,2,farming
xgaz5y,1,Studies show the main factor in farm profitability is yield with higher yielding farms making more money.  Higher yields mean higher inputs.,0,,,1,farming
