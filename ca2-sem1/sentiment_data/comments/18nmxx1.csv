Liquid fertilizer shows up liquid. There aren’t many dry products dissolved onsite.

18nmxx1,1,"I use a silo to inject soluble gypsum into my drip system. 

I spread 0-0-50 and 11-52-0 dry in the fall to get the volume of product I need. I still run some liquid product in the drip in season, but it’s cost prohibitive to do liquid at the rate I need. And we run UAN32 in the drip for all our N. 

I guess I’d be curious how to setup silos to hopefully make it all cheaper in the long run, but the silo for the gyp wasn’t cheap. I can’t imagine setting up two or three more for one system, but I’d consider it. Who knows? Maybe it’s cheaper in the long run.",0,,,3,farming
18nmxx1,2,"Dry material applied directly is usually cheaper than liquid on a per pound of nutrient basis. Liquid is easier to handle, though. 

Liquids made from dry on-farm for big agronomic crops isn’t too common.",0,,,2,farming
18nmxx1,3,"Yet, liquid made from dry would probably be a lot cheaper in the long run. I did some cost math comparing soluble gyp applied with diamond k applicator vs injecting Calcium Thiosulfate in to the drip line. The material costs difference for the calcium was $3.04 for the CaTs, vs $0.11/lbs for the soluble gypsum.

But I farm on drip in California. I'm not sure what big agronomic crop your comparing me to, but it's getting more common out here with the water quality we are dealing with.",0,,,2,farming
18nmxx1,4,"Liquid made from dry is how I've seen hemp farms run in Colorado. Batch mixing concentrates then using some kind of adjustable rate injection to hit your numbers. Buying pallets of each dry salt, making RO from collected rainwater for the concentrates.",0,,,2,farming
18nmxx1,1,I would disagree with “dissolved is dissolved”. Liquid Fertilizers have different viscosities which can make them more difficult to inject in drip than others. But that maybe only applies to crops using drip,0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,1,"Okay.

For ref: (The recipe for this 500 gallon nutrient test batch is 3025 lbs. water, 302 lbs. potassium nitrate, 680 lbs. of calcium nitrate, 90 lbs. of urea, and 303 lbs. of magnesium nitrate. That takes roughly 30min to process in the reactor; the only consumable for processing is electricity. Reactor and all hardware can fit in a pickup bed.)

These salts do not dissolve in liquid, the microscope images will show this. (Surface tension and salting-out analysis points to this as well)

Here are some images:

18nmxx1,0,"We use a fertigation system that gets pumped through our t-tape and polydrip lines. We apply once a week. We typically will fertigate strawberries, Tomatoes, Peppers, cucumber, Zucchini, snap peas, green beans while all the other crops get overhead watered",0,,,4,farming
18nmxx1,0,We buy bags/ totes of dry product and mix our fertilizers in to liquid and put in holding tanks. We decant from the holding tanks to our application equipment and apply.

18nmxx1,0,"What do you mean by large scale?   NPK is more something I would use in gardening or veggies.  

Large scale grains apply each individually.  Especially corn with Anhydrous Ammonia as a liquid injected in the ground.  

How well does your tech scale?  How is distribution?

Farmers need millions of tons quickly and easily handled.",0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,0,"Yeah, I use all liquid because I don't want to touch dry. Other people have the opposite preference. I'm guessing the vast majority of both don't want an extra step of turning dry into liquid on the farm before applying it.

I don't know how liquid fertilizer is made before I pick it up in my tanker at the coop, but maybe your target market is fertilizer manufacturers and not end user producers.",0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,0,"Unfortunately there's no straight answer to all of your questions, different farms will have totally different considerations and every field has to be managed differently. I'll try and give you some considerations, but it is only the top of the iceberg. 

I'll also assume you aren't talking about anhydrous ammonia liquid applications because that is a different beast. 

>When is liquid fertilizer (of a NPK or similar blend) utilized over a solid fertilizer?

The benefits of granular and prill are that you can control precise location and depth. If you're planting an annual crop, you can place the fertilizer at the time of seeding so that it is close enough to the plant to be available, but not so close that it will burn the seed. 

A disadvantage to liquid fert with annual crops is that it is usually imprecise and can only be applied on the surface and it will rely on natural soil drainage to get the the seed. This also means it is more succeptible to leaching and volatilization. Leaching is a concern with sandier soils with low water holding capacity. Volatilization gets worse with higher temperatures when surface-dressed nitrogen doesn't get incorporated before it boils off. 

For perennial crops, granular tends to be less suitable as you're not disturbing the soil with seeding operations, and will mostly be broadcasting. The timing of fertilizer uptake is less critical, and liquid fert becomes a better option. 

Liquid fert can also be used in fertigation systems, and can be applied a lot more efficiently if the equipment exists. 

>(of a NPK or similar blend)

Huh? This suggests you need to be doing a bit more research into fertilizer types before talking about bringing some type of aggregator to market. There is no ""NPK blend."" Fertilizers can contain (among other things) N, P, and K. In some respect, I would say that most fertilizers are ""NPK""

> Do you receive the liquid fertilizer (of NPK or similar type) pre-mixed in liquid or do you make it onsite?

On-site, anyhydrous notwithstanding. Shipping water is expensive.

I posted a response to the top voted comment if you would mind checking that out. For some reason copying that isn’t working correctly.",0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,0,"The majority of liquid fertilizer applied on corn and beans land is at planting.    Modern planters have a nutrient tank and apply the fertilizer in-furrow or 2x2 (2 inches down and two inches over from the seed).    In furrow nutrient for corn is typically a ""pop up"" fertilizer, 0-30-10-Zn or something like that.   The 2x2 also includes nitrogen.

The planter from John Deere used for this is call the Exact Emerge line of planters.   They come with an optional liquid nutrient system that can add liquid fertilizer during planting, Exact Rate.

I am not sure how the liquid fertilizer is sold or manufactured.    If you can offer a cheaper source of liquid fertilizer by mixing it yourself, you may have a service/device that farmers would buy.",0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,0,"What type of crop and customer is your market?

18nmxx1,1,"Quite frankly I don’t quite know yet.

I’m trying to soak in all the info I can about crops, fertilizer treatment types, etc

I’m trying to find a crop type(s) that already utilizes liquid fertilizer (with dissolved salts) in a region of the us (I am NH based) to study an implementation of this technology.

18nmxx1,2,Go to a small town that farmers frequent that has a small dinner open for coffee in the morning. Just go and have coffee and listen to the talk and see if they can give you any feedback. Don't make it a sales pitch make it a learning experience.,0,,,1,farming
18nmxx1,0,"I’m a veggies and fruit farmer and most of my fertilizer application is Liquid fertilizer via a water pump pumping water from the river and me injecting it with another pump directly to the irrigation line. Most of my fertilizers come into a tank already premixed. Some of them are already ready to sell by the tote (275 gallons) or I can get a certain fertilizer blended or mixed to my specific needs for different crops from sweet corn to peppers to strawberries. 8-2-2, 28-0-0, 32-0-0, are just a few ones I use. And you can get them with or without micronutrients added. 
If I need something more potent, the another way I do this is by mixing or adding water soluble fertilizers myself. For example I’ll fill a tote of water with 250 gallons of water and then I’ll add and mix 1-3 50lb bags of water soluble greenhouse grade calcium nitrate with 1-3 bags of 50lb of greenhouse grade potassium nitrate as per my needs. Keep in mind these are fertilizers  are not liquid. Theyre sold in bags and are solid pellets but will almost instantly dissolve once you throw them in the water and mix them up with a shovel or a drill mixer. 
Again I’m speaking to my experience. Not sure what kind of farmer you are but that’s how we veggie and fruit farmers that use drip line irrigation get our stuff fertilized via liquid fertilizer. 
And don’t worry too much about runoff. I farm in the mountains too and on uneven fields. I don’t have runoff problems. As long as you fertilize correctly and the correct rates it’s all good the plant will eat it up fairly quickly and the roots will absorb it",0,,,1,farming
