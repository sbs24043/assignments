""Extremely dry weather has caused severe damage to grain crops in some parts of France and substantial rain will be needed by early June to allow those in large producing regions to pull through, an agricultural institute said on Thursday.""

Food scarcity is a major concern as it relates to collapse.

March was exceptional sunny and dry, first two weeks of April had rain but the rest of April dry again and May has mostly been dry. So I am not expecting it to change drastically in June and/or July. Also you cannot expect it will be good for the farms / crops if you get a buckload of rain in such a short timespan to 'counter' the rain shortage. So yea GG.

uyo7a5,2,"It actually would be a benefit to earth if the AMOC collapses, poles will get cold and potentially restart glaciation, (but who knows what will happen with the amount of Energy we have put into the system). It would still screw up weather systems, at the same time equatorial regions would receive even warmer weather so it’s only good long term (1000 years). This is a potential feedback loop for stabilizing the planet, not our civilization.

Edit: Apparently, my midnight rambling wasn’t clear....This will totally screw up civilization by increase winter storms in north and hurricanes, storms in the equatorial regions...humans will die en mass but it will stabilize earth climate and prevent hot house earth over a period of 100 to 1000 years of glaciation.

uyo7a5,0,">""Whether it be for corn, sunflower or sorghum, when there is no water there is no plant,"" he said, noting that many farmers were using their irrigation quota to ""save their wheat crops"".

so mostly feed crops (yes, all those vegetable oils produce ""cake"" which is the stuff left behind after squeezing them, and that's top quality concentrated feed)

The animal farmers are going to be begging for subsidies intensely, perhaps with less dung to waste in protests. The thing is that the more these sectors are saved, the worse it's going to get for everyone, since subsidies for feed crops will ensure more feed crops get planted, instead of food crops.

The second someone brings up phytonutrients and anti nutrients I know they are not quoting any actual research but instead 'common knowledge.'. Next you will tell me that our ancestors knew best and that is why they sold their grains. Yeah, soaked grain cooks faster with limited fuel.  Lol.

But you tip your hand nicely when you bring up vegans.  I cannot understand why veganism is a thing.  Did you know that people who eat meat can still be scientifically based in their arguments for eating less meat?  Or can believe there are many alternative foods to get iron from?  Or that there is actual value in eating less meat?
