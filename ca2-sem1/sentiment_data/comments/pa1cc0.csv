pa1cc0,0,"Assuming you're in the USA, there should be a county extension agent there somewhere. These folks work through land grant universities ag departments.

That person can advise you on cash rent rates,county average yields, and probably point you toward some successful farmers in the area.

There are three main ways farms are rented. You can look these up online and read more.

Cash rent:  the farmer pays a fixed amount per acre to use the land.  Zero risk to the land owner from crop loss or market conditions.  Landlord should ask for yield and fertilizer records to make sure the farmer isn't mining the soil. Around here (central Missouri) the dirt will produce 200 to 240 bu corn on average and 50 to 65 bushel beans.  Cash rent ranges from $160 to $200 per acre depending on many factors. Landlord is responsible for property tax and lime to balance soil ph. You also want a farm liability insurance policy.  Tax wise you will use Schedule C just like other rental property.  Your expenses (tax, lime, insurance, cost to visit, etc) are deductible.

Crop Share: You own a percentage of the crop at harvest.  There are numerous versions of this method.  They range from the landlord paying for nothing and getting 20% to 30% of the crop delivered to a local grain merchandiser at harvest to a 50-50 arrangement where the landlord pays for half the cost to raise the crop and the farmer puts in half.  Taxes and insurance are still on the landlord.  Landlord is now assuming part of the risk of bad crops or crappy market conditions.  This is typically more profitable for the landlord and gets you on Schedule F for taxes.  You'll want to buy crop insurance covering your share if you go this way.

Custom Farming: here you manage everything or hire a local farm manager for a cut.  Farm owner buys all inputs and pays the farmer or co-op by the acre to do each operation, spray, plant, harvest, and hauling to the elevator.  Requires knowledge of how to farm, or hiring someone who does.  Most profitable method for the landowner.  Popular with retired farmers who still like to gamble.  Schedule F again.

Those are the highlights.  Your first trip after you inherited this should be with the FSA (USDA Farm Services Administration) office in the county your farm is in.  Your farm has a farm number that is the key to it's history with the USDA.

They need to get all info on your farm updated and (at least in my county) they are very helpful and informative.  They will tell you much about your farm, what programs it is enrolled in, what your historic yeilds are, and what assistance it may qualify for.  You want to be nice to these folks as they can be a good asset and resource.  They can also point you to the extension agent.

They will want to see a copy of the deed showing you as the owner.  You can call and make an appointment which can be over the phone, and paperwork can be shuffled via email and electronic signatures, but I suggest a visit in person.  Farm folks want to get to know you.

If you have family or friends in the area, they can also point out some farmers to talk to.  I'd also advise you to find the names of the farmers whose land surrounds yours.  

Contact them and introduce yourself.  If they are farmers just ask if they're interested in renting and what arrangements they prefer or have with other landlords. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  The good ones will enjoy teaching you how it works.

Also, after you talk to several, you'll get a feel for who's good to work with and who seems full of shit.  There's plenty of both to go around.  

To me, the key is the relationship between farmer and landlord has to be a win-win.  Therefore you need a farmer you trust and you yourself can't be a demanding asshole.  You both have to make a reasonable profit or the relationship won't last.  That's the same for all businesses, not just farming.

Avoid turning the rent or lease of your farm into a bidding war.  Thats pretty common now and it's a great way to wind up with a farmer who mines your soil for a few years and them drops you and leaves you with a ""fixer upper"" farm.  Bidding wars just piss off most of the good farmers who would have taken care of you for the long run.

Land ownership is not the place to try and milk every penny out of the guy you're dealing with for instant profits.  Look at it as a long haul partnership, not a used car lot.",0,,,76,farming
pa1cc0,1,Wow. Thank you for taking the time to write this up. I really appreciate this and its incredibly helpful.,0,,,22,farming
pa1cc0,2,"You're welcome.  Glad I could help.

I hope I got across that cash rent gives you guaranteed income with almost no risk but does not maximize the landlords income.

Crop share will make you more but you have to sell your share yourself and need to understand how to maximize the marketing.  Old saying in farm country, ""I don't make money growing corn, I make money selling corn.""  It's not too hard to figure out how, but like all farming, it's takes some gambling.  Like contracting a portion of your crop ahead during the winter when offers to buy are higher.  You can lock in a higher market price but you better hope mother nature lets you have a crop to sell.  That's where crop insurance is your friend.  

Custom farming maximizes income but also requires a big cash outlay up front each season and therefore carries significant risk.  You're on your own for weather issues and marketing.

As you can see, farming is a lot like gambling.  You toss three to five hundred dollars per acre out there in the dirt and hope you get something to sell in a market you have little control over. And like gambling those who know the game best and are good at it win more.  Those that aren't can lose everything.  Hell, once in a while even the best players lose.",0,,,15,farming
pa1cc0,3,"With the little information I have. It seems to me Either renting or crop sharing is the best route for me. The route would require to much attention from me that I cannot give to the farm. 

I also appreciate you reaffirming the relationship aspect. While again, I'm not a farmer myself. I did come from a farming family and all the great values that entails being raised up in such an environment. Id like to be diplomatic with whoever the farmer is working for me. Build a long stable relationship so that I have someone I can trust for as long as they want to work it. And they have a stable piece of income they can rely on more. 

I have a few other questions if you don't mind. 

Any recommendations on resources to understanding crop sharing? This peaks my interest because this increases my ability to cover the cost of the farm making it more self sustainable. 

Additionally, seeing as I have a small farm. What will my relationship be with some of these major farm corporations like Monsanto be? How do I keep my soil healthy? Not destroy my soil or kill the good land I have. How do I make decisions with what seeds I have used on my farm and methods of pest control to keep the land healthy. I don't want to poison what I have. This is important to me. 

Thanks again.",0,,,7,farming
pa1cc0,4,"Hey. I forgot to add that keeping your soil healthy is why you want a good farmer that is soil health and conservation minded.  All farmers raising commodity corn, beans, wheat and such are going to use herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides if necessary.

Things are much more controlled and scientific that even 20 years ago.  Everybody's gotten smarter about their use.

And they're expensive so trust me, nobody is going to use more than necessary.  The landlord might have to push the farmer to spend more on fertilizer so rest assured he's not going to spend more on pesticides than he has to.

You can always try finding an organic farmer to rent your farm, but be careful as you may wind up back at fixer-upper stage. As organic takes you back to lots of tillage for weed control it can be hard on soil health.  You'll also have weeds anyway so you'll be adding to the seed bank in the soil.",0,,,6,farming

pa1cc0,1,This is the best reply here.,0,,,9,farming
pa1cc0,2,"Thanks.  Kind of hard to answer questions like OP's with a few sentences.

And I'm pretty adamant about the key to success as a land owner is to look at at the landlord/farmer relationship as a partnership.  Your farmer is not your employee, at most he is a contractor, if you want to look at it from the businessmans perspective.

But I learned a long time ago that a common characteristic of most all successful businesses is developing that win-win relationship with your suppliers and customers. We had a saying at the most successful company I ever worked for; ""we want to be our suppliers favorite customer and our customers favorite supplier.""",0,,,12,farming
pa1cc0,3,"We're dealing with some relatives that are of the difficult type right now. My dad and I farm, and when grandpa died, most of the ground went to the relatives that have lived in the cities for 40 years, 12 hours from here and haven't seen the ground in 10 years. They only see dollar signs. It's frustrating, haha.",0,,,6,farming
pa1cc0,4,"I feel for you.  Some young farmers I know got caught in one of those.  They rented from an old retired farmer and helped him out a bunch. Did crop share and marketed his share for him along with their own.  Built up his depleted soil. Cleared a lot of brush for free.  Fixed terraces and field tiles.  After about four years the farm was producing better than ever.

The old guy died and relatives off in the city took over.  They immediately told my friends they were switching to cash rent and put the farm out for bids.  They tried to explain all the work and money they put into it but they didn't care as I doubt they had a clue what any of it meant.

So they bid on it and another old asshole in the neighborhood who knew all the money they spent on it bid $50 an acre more than the typical rate around here for the best land.  Then the guy proceeded to cut back on P and K, did minimal weed control, never cleaned up or mowed anything for four years.  Once the yields dropped off significantly he gave up the farm.

The owners then came and offered it to the friends for what the last guy was paying.  They said no thanks.

It got mined for one more year by another guy and then they sold it.

I'm sure they got a pile of money for it regardless of the condition but from my view they fucked themselves.  They could be enjoying  decent income from that 160 acres forever and still owned the asset that they could borrow against if necessary, and then pass it to the next generation.

That's basically why I wrote that manuscript for OP.  if he finds some good folks to work with it'll be a good experience. Being greedy and cut-throat isn't the way to go in my opinion.",0,,,9,farming
pa1cc0,1,"This is amazingly useful, thank you. Please explain more about soil mining. As a layman, even if I get the fertiliser records, how can I recognise ""red flags"" that suggest the farmer is over doing it?",0,,,3,farming
pa1cc0,2,"There are charts published by many university researchers that tell you the amount of nutrients removed from the soil by the yield for most all crops grown in any region.

The rule of thumb is you put back what the crop removes.  There are exceptions so if it appears something is amiss, the best move is to ask the renter why? There may be valid reasons.

If your farmer doesn't know anything about nutrient balance or the removal rate, that's the red flag.

And on the topic of soil health, the landlord should have soil tests done for his own records.  Do it before renting out to a new farmer.  Local co-op or fertilizer supplier can get that done. It's not free but not terribly expensive.  You don't have to do it every year. Typically done during the late fall after harvest.

Then if you become concerned, do another soil test.  The farmer is expected to maintain the nutrient lever where it was when he started.

If a farm has poor soil that has been depleted, then the landlord should work with the farmer on a plan to build it up, if possible.  Cover crops can build soil organic matter.  The farmer can put extra nutrients on each year.  But those things cost money so the expectation is that the farmers extra expense is reflected in reduced rent.

Soil type also has a big influence on rent rates. Not every farm in the county has the same kind of dirt.  Most all farms have different soil types on the same farm.  Some soil types just raise better crops.  Some poor soils will only raise a certain amount no matter how much fertilizer you pour on it.  So there is an optimum level for each soil type for maximum profitability without mining the soil.

This topic is where some absentee landlords create their own problems.  Just because some old high school friend knows somebody who's getting $300 an acre cash rent doesn't mean all farms in the area are worth that.  Some dirt is better than others.

Iowa has a lot of good dirt. So does Illinois.  But here in Missouri, for example, there's only about 10 or 12 counties in the whole state that have really good soil types throughout the whole county for row crop production.",0,,,6,farming
pa1cc0,1,Bravo! 👏👏👏,0,,,3,farming
pa1cc0,2,"Thanks.  Sometimes my coffee fueled breakfast Reddit comments get a bit wordy.  I figured the answer to OP's question deserved a decent explanation from my point of view. 

I see this quite a bit.  I'm retired and lucky to have the three son's of a couple I grew up with do the row crop farming and haying now.  They're hard working good farmers and my farm is doing better than it ever had. I'd guess they're farming around 3000 to 3500 row crop acres now, and about half is rented ground.

I help them some and ride with them occasionally.  I get lots of stories about dealing with absentee landlords, and the crazy stuff that happens when an old retired farmer dies and his heirs take over.",0,,,2,farming

pa1cc0,1,"Coming onto this comment **very** late. If I were looking instead to buy farmland to then rent out, do you have any tips on how to evaluate pricing? I'm looking to try to buy farmland to eventually retire to, but I am not quite ready to move yet and I wanted to rent out the farmland for a decade or more in the meantime. I was also looking into how to get a loan for it, and I assume I would just go through a bank, but it looks like the USDA does farm loans... but they're 'restricted' to people who have experience farming. 

So I guess, do you have any general tips for someone who is looking to buy farmland to eventually move to and either sharecrop or rent out? Are there some resources you would recommend that I could read to learn more about farming theory, farm financing, etc.?",0,,,1,farming
pa1cc0,0,Simply find someone to rent the land from you to farm and they'll make all the decisions and do all the work. You just price the land to cover taxes and make a few bucks.,0,,,8,farming
pa1cc0,1,I like to be more knowledgeable about whats actually happening than be completely blind. Want to educate myself on this.,0,,,3,farming
pa1cc0,2,"If you're renting it out, the farmer's going to drive most of those decisions on crop rotation, what to plant and such. They'll work with you for maintenance like ditch digging, tree fence cutting, drainage tiles and such, but generally they'll want a 3-5 year deal so they'll keep track of fertilizers and other soil adjustments as needed. They're paying you to do whatever they want with your land, and the contract between you prevents them from fucking it up too badly. 

If you go the rental route, in your OP, #2, 4, and 5 are not applicable. You don't share profit, you calculate what your taxes/land is worth per acre and charge the farmer enough to cover those taxes, other expenses, and meet the price for similar land costs. The farmer pays that rent every year, regardless of what crops they choose to plant and how much profit they're getting per acre - most years they come out ahead, some years they don't - you still get paid. If the farmer wants to plant wheat, carrots, beets, or canola instead of corn and soy, you shouldn't really be getting in his way because profit/loss of the crop is not on you at all. 

Now, to take a more active role and not rent out your land, if you have no machinery, you can still farm it yourself by hiring people for those tasks. It's called custom work - you pay other farmers to come plant and harvest your fields for you, you can pay the co-op to come spray it, you don't have to sit a day in a tractor seat, but it'll all get done.  Downsides - farmers are going to get their own shit done first, so your timing might be a little off if you don't have enough connections in the area. It's going to cost more per acre than doing it yourself because wages, repairs, and maintenance are all tied up in those custom fees you'll be paying. Crop yields and returns are going to be your problem now, some years you'll see returns in the 8-10% of land value range, some years will be in the red, and all poor decisions will be entirely your own fuckup. And as hands-off as this route is, I wouldn't try this if you're not actively living there or visiting every few weeks - lots of shit can happen and you can't just ignore crops and trust it's going to go well.",0,,,3,farming
