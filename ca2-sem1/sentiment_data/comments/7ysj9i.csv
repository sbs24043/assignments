Another example is Chipotle bragging about being GMO-free while still using a non-GMO herbicide resistant sunflower. 

Overall, GMOs have significantly reduced the use of pesticides, which is one of the primary reasons why farmers use them. It doesn't make sense for a farmer to spray more pesticide. A few examples: 

[Meta-analysis of 147 studies: GMOs increase yield by 22%, reduce pesticide use by 37%, and increase farmer profits by 68% (and more in developing countries).](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629)

7ysj9i,4,"I'm extremely pro-GMO. So much so that I actively avoid companies that are ""GMO-free"". In my opinion, being ""GMO-free"" is a sign of willful ignorance at best, and outright scientific denial with a side of fear-mongering at the worst.

The most compelling argument I've heard for being against GMO's is regarding the pesticide use. Since you can make a crop more resistant to a particular pesticide that you might not otherwise be able to use, you could have unintended consequences on the surrounding ecosystem. GMO's allow you to potentially introduce harmful pesticides much easier since your plants can be immune.

Do you think that argument holds any water?",0,,,56,science
7ysj9i,5,"I'm not the guy you're responding too, so I'll let him tackle the argument you provided. I've heard that used before, but many of the real world cases I've read about that have the pesticides use as a factor were due to either the company selling the crops ignoring the fact that their recommendations were not appropriate for their GMO strains, or the farmers themselves poured pesticides onto them without caring.

Basically things that must be regulated via policy and education, instead of banning GMOs.

I do 100% agree with your first paragraph, though I still buy an orange juice that does say ""non-GMO"", simply because their juice is great and I bought it before they started labelling their product with that giant NON-GMO label... Despite the fact I am quite certain they NEVER used any crops with GMO's in them. Everything else, if it has a giant label at the front, I do try and not buy.

The same with that candy/snack that says ""simple and pronounceable ingredients"".

7ysj9i,5,"I avoid GMO-free products as well, and I often contact companies to let them know that I'm avoiding their products. Their responses are canned and disappointing and often mention that ""mothers have serious concerns about GMOs.""

In terms of ecosystem impacts, I think the above sources clearly convey that GMOs generally reduce pesticide use which obviously provides a positive impact. 

Herbicide resistance tends to be a more nuanced issue. Here, glyphosate resistance is the major GM trait. Glyphosate is used even in farming without GMOs, but obviously it's far more commonly used with GM crops. Collectively, [glyphosate safety is supported by 1000+ studies spanning half a century](http://www.glyphosate.eu/database) as well as every major global organization, including the EPA, USDA, FDA, EU, WHO, etc. 

I commonly hear people say that ""farmers drench their fields with glyphosate,"" which isn't the case. Another misconception is that glyphosate tolerant crops can withstand huge doses of glyphosate, which actually isn't true. Excessive glyphosate applications actually do stunt the growth and development of glyphosate tolerant crops. ([Here's a very informal example of this.](https://www.facebook.com/welovegv/photos/pcb.1908017482801631/1908016082801771/?type=3&theater))  

With the introduction of glyphosate resistant crops, herbicide use has remained roughly static, while farmers have largely switched to using glyphosate which is far less toxic than the previously used herbicides that dominated the market, like atrazine. 

Sure, there's the threat of herbicide resistance in weed species, but the is an issue regardless of a crop's GMO status. In fact, [there isn't an increase in ""superweeds"" with the introduction of GMOs.](http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HerbicideResistanceOverTime.png) Herbicide resistant weeds can also be largely avoided with proper herbicide rotations.

United States animal agriculture produces over 9 billion food-producing animals annually, and more than 95% of these animals consume feed containing GE ingredients. Data on livestock productivity and health were collated from publicly available sources from 1983, before the introduction of GE crops in 1996, and subsequently through 2011, a period with high levels of predominately GE animal feed. These field data sets representing over 100 billion animals following the introduction of GE crops did not reveal unfavorable or perturbed trends in livestock health and productivity. No study has revealed any differences in the nutritional profile of animal products derived from GE-fed animals. Because DNA and protein are normal components of the diet that are digested, there are no detectable or reliably quantifiable traces of GE components in milk, meat, and eggs following consumption of GE feed.""",0,,,261,science

>**Abstract**

>Despite the extensive cultivation of genetically engineered (GE) maize and considerable number of scientific reports on its agro-environmental impact, the risks and benefits of GE maize are still being debated and concerns about safety remain. This meta-analysis aimed at increasing knowledge on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits of GE maize by analyzing the peer-reviewed literature (from 1996 to 2016) on yield, grain quality, non-target organisms (NTOs), target organisms (TOs) and soil biomass decomposition. Results provided strong evidence that GE maize performed better than its near isogenic line: grain yield was 5.6 to 24.5% higher with lower concentrations of mycotoxins (−28.8%), fumonisin (−30.6%) and thricotecens (−36.5%). The NTOs analyzed were not affected by GE maize, except for Braconidae, represented by a parasitoid of European corn borer, the target of Lepidoptera active Bt maize. Biogeochemical cycle parameters such as lignin content in stalks and leaves did not vary, whereas biomass decomposition was higher in GE maize. The results support the cultivation of GE maize, mainly due to enhanced grain quality and reduction of human exposure to mycotoxins. Furthermore, the reduction of the parasitoid of the target and the lack of consistent effects on other NTOs are confirmed.",0,,,114,science

The fear of the unknown, agriculture, but also having to rely on it for subsistence, is what I assume makes tensions high. 

On another side, you have scientists who have spent their careers refining the processes and techniques in genetic engineering and are heavily vested in it's success and believe they are helping humanity's collective steady progress. 

I'm a rudimentary plant scientist and farmer, I haven't found a GE crop I would be interested in purchasing and propagating. There are some interesting positive applications like SUNY-ESF & ACF transgenic American Chestnut resistant to blight http://www.esf.edu/chestnut/resistance.htm . The implications of a return of 100 ft tall trees that produce nuts every year could be a boon to animals & humans & alter the ecology of the eastern U.S.

If a farmer wishes to use GE crops it is their choice, but the genetic drift in open pollinated crops like corn is troubling. Genes that have no evolutionary context are reproducing in the wild, a pandora's box if you will.

I don't believe GE is a dues ex machina. It is a technology & can be used to increase yield/nutrition or to increase profit & market share or other novel things. 

The methods in this meta-analysis seem to be sound and of a reputable source. I've never claimed GE crops produce ill effects on consumption, but the top down, one-size-fits-all approach to agriculture is dangerous.

 I believe the problems of feeding the world, soil loss, and pollution are best combated with better cultural practices. Perennial poly-culture systems like forests and prairie are extremely productive and have evolved over thousands of years, unfortunately it is all too easy to lose those reciprocal systems and hard/impossible to re-implement them.

If you go to the linked article, you can click through to the full study as it was published in Nature, scientific Reports, which is an open access journal. The impact of said journal--one way to assess the legitimacy of it--is upwards of 4 making it a reliable journal, not great like Nature or Cell but isn't to be dismissed. For reference, only 2% of scientific journals achieve an impact score higher than 10. You can find the impact of any journal by simply googling ""impact factor"" or ""impact score"" and the name of the journal. The lower the number the lower the impact, and no impact either means pay to play journal or a journal that is too young to have received an impact factor. 

It is a peer reviewed study, though I haven't gone through each editor of the journal to look at their funding, and reviewers are kept anonymous (which is standard practice in the field, not something to be skeptical of). 

The authors are based out of Italy, you can find them on the first page and their affiliations on the author information page of the full study. They declare no conflicts of interest. This is where funding conflicts such as those contributed by the industry would be found. it is standard practice to report them, while the lack of declared conflicts of interest doesn't mean they aren't there as of course the authors could be lying if you choose to believe that.

Well, monoculture/diversity is a separate issue from GMO.  If farmers choose to plant enormous fields of some non-GMO strain of corn, and if all farmers choose the same strain because it gives highest yield, you have a lack of diversity.  No different than if they all choose the same GMO strain of corn because it gives the highest yield.

Do GMO crops “foster monoculture?” This is a frequent criticism of modern agriculture. I have three problems with it:

1- “Monoculture” isn’t the right term to use to describe the relevant issues – its really about a limited crop rotation

2- History and economics are the drivers behind this phenomenon, not crop biotechnology

3- The solutions – to the extent that they are needed – are not what most critics seem to imagine
