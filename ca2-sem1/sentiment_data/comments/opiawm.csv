*RNA demethylation increases the yield and biomass of rice and potato plants in field trials*

>**Abstract**

>RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications are essential in plants. Here, we show that transgenic expression of the human RNA demethylase FTO in rice caused a more than threefold increase in grain yield under greenhouse conditions. In field trials, transgenic expression of FTO in rice and potato caused ~50% increases in yield and biomass. We demonstrate that the presence of FTO stimulates root meristem cell proliferation and tiller bud formation and promotes photosynthetic efficiency and drought tolerance but has no effect on mature cell size, shoot meristem cell proliferation, root diameter, plant height or ploidy. FTO mediates substantial m6A demethylation (around 7% of demethylation in poly(A) RNA and around 35% decrease of m6A in non-ribosomal nuclear RNA) in plant RNA, inducing chromatin openness and transcriptional activation. Therefore, modulation of plant RNA m6A methylation is a promising strategy to dramatically improve plant growth and crop yield.",0,,,24,science

opiawm,1,"> RNA demethylase
> FTO

Living things (the ones we know about) have genes. Genes are little sequences of DNA that are a sort of blueprint. The cell machinery makes RNA from that blueprint. The RNA is used for many things. RNA and DNA can be ""methylated"", meaning a little molecule peice called a ""methyl group"" is added to the DNA/RNA.

So, there is a human gene called ""RNA demethylase FTO"". It is a gene that makes a little blueprint for an enzyme that ""demethylates"", meaning removing that little methyl group. Demethylation has a number of functions. I think in this case it regulates certain cellular processes.

This is a truly meaningless statement, this is like saying that there is enough fresh water in the world for everyone to drink but it isn't distributed properly. How would we distribute water from Canada to water starving countries in subsaharan Africa or Saudi Arabia. This fact doesn't help anyone. Even if you took away the agricultural inefficiencies and losses people would still not be able to meet their nutritional and caloric needs.

Measures need to be taken to increase food production in regions that are food stressed. Measures need to be taken to generate clean water in water stressed region. 

>There is also an insane amount of crops dedicated to feed animals that we eat.

Irrelevant, if we stopped feeding it to animals it doesn't magically go into peoples mouths. Farmers grow food for animals because they're paid to grow food for animals. If starving humans could afford to pay farmers to grow food for them they would do it. If you take away the animals it doesn't mean people get fed, it just means those fields are used for other purposes or reclaimed by nature. We use Alot of water for animals as well, it doesn't mean we can ship it over to Saudi Arabia if we stop giving it to animals.

Mitigation of food waste in starving countries only partially ameliorates the issue. The bigger problem is that the food is too expensive for them to buy. Measures that decrease human agricultural labor. 

Not to mention if you ""distributed"" food to these countries. You would just kill their domestic ag sector and make them reliant on rich countries.",0,,,1,science
