>	Diurnal temperature range, which is defined as the difference between the daily maximum (Tmax) and daily minimum air temperature (Tmin), is a critical factor that modulates local climate, ecosystem, and socio-economic functioning. This study investigates how global warming impacts diurnal temperature range (DTR) using a high resolution numerical model. Results demonstrate the asymmetrical response to global warming, that is, the more substantial warming is confirmed in Tmin, and the lower in Tmax. This asymmetry results in the DTR reduction of approximately 0.5°K in the mid-latitude and 0.25°K in the low-altitude area. A cause of the DTR reduction is the daytime-cloudiness increase under warmer climates, which reduces short-wave solar radiation reaching the surface, consequently causing the Tmax “underwarming.” Also, the difference in atmospheric instability in the mid- and low-latitude areas explains the difference in the DTR response, that is, more moderate DTR reduction is confirmed in low latitude areas.

yhmhl5,0,"Re: diurnal temperature range (DTR) 

I’m confused. I thought a key issue of climate change was that you would have more seasonal variability and greater extremes, not a reduction in variation. 

I wonder if this correlates with rainfall variability declining?

I assume heatwaves then will be on top of a pronounced higher base temperature for more of the year.",0,,,1,science
yhmhl5,1,"Global heating brings unpredictable extremes but it also evens out differences in average temperatures, with winters warming a bit more than summers, nights warming more than days, the Arctic warming more than temperate latitudes, etc..",0,,,1,science
