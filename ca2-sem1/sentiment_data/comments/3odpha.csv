Science advocacy is extremely important to me. My family, who I love dearly, is extremely ignorant of most science, and is randomly taken by lots of alt med quackery. The influence of religion has also been difficult to navigate.

Being informed is important, and I think being able to convey your work to the public, or at least find people who can and give them the tools to do so, is extremely important for scientists. This has nothing to do with people being dumb, as I know some incredibly intelligent people who are distrustful of science, and everything to do with being informed.

I'm really glad to see scientific periodicals starting to pay attention to this, and that scientists as a whole are getting more and more invested in outreach.

It shouldn't be up to an individual construction worker's knowledge or beliefs to decide whether to or not to use asbestos, and even if it were the fact is that the choice of the construction worker impacts other people around them; it's not fair for other workers, for occupants, or for the general public to get mesothelioma just because one person ""doesn't believe that big government has any right to dictate what materials can be used for construction"" or something similar. Same goes with vaccination and roadworthy vehicles and CFCs and a whole array of other matters which go beyond the individual and become matters of public health, safety, and well-being.",0,,,91,science

3odpha,5,"The problem is that there IS still a large risk to eating GM crops. It's just not from the genetic modification itself. Unfortunately, everything has been confused and mixed up.

Genetic modification itself is obviously not risky in and of itself. The risk comes from the types of modifications made and unintended consequences. For example, many of the most popular genetically modified crops in the USA have not been modified to be more nutritious, hardy to cold weather, drought-resistant, or those sorts of things you would expect. Many of the modifications have been to make crops more resistant to higher doses of pesticides. This is what Monsanto's Roundup Ready crops are. Monsanto as a corporation is obligated to maximize profits - not public wellbeing or sustainability. Meanwhile, some countries have started banning Roundup pesticide because we're starting to learn it actually does cause harm.

Europe has banned modifications not because they are scared of GM, but rather as a precautionary measure against unintended consequences of GM, such as corporations modifying genes faster than we can test and react to.",0,,,18,science
3odpha,6,"GM should then just be properly tested before released for human consumption, like new drugs, and not ban the process if genetic modification altogether.

3odpha,6,"By this reasoning, you must also ban all conventional breeding as well under the ""precautionary"" principle.",0,,,1,science
3odpha,7,"Good point. The reason precautionary principle is applied to GM more strongly to conventional breeding is that conventional breeding is very slow - sometimes only a few generations/lifetime - so whatever changes are made to the crops are gradual and give us time to test and react. Also, conventional breeding doesn't throw in new unknowns like jellyfish genes that we haven't had time to fully examine when placed in our food.",0,,,1,science
3odpha,8,"Generation times are typically the same regardless of GM or not. After inserting the gene, you still need to go through your breeding cycles for multiple generations like anything else assuming you are going for a hybrid.

Conventional breeding actually does throw out unknowns pretty often. You can get a mutation are a extremely recessive trait that ramps up production of a poisonous compound. That can especially happen when we introgress genes from wild type plants that haven't been consumed as a crop.

Tl;dr, not knowing about general unknowns makes unknowns about GMOs seem scarier.",0,,,1,science
3odpha,6,What kind of harm is roundup causing? Can you link me a scientific study?,0,,,1,science
3odpha,7,"I don't have any specific one. I just Google Scholared the topic and found this one: http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/s12302-014-0014-5.pdf

It shows harmful effects on mice. Apparently it is quite controversial, but hasn't been disproven. I've done a fair amount of study on Glyphosphate (Roundup). It was originally used a a pipe de-scaler to clean pipes from mineral and metal buildup. It binds strongly to metals; that's how it kills certain organisms. Apparently, we're only now discovering that it's lethal to bacteria, which are of course very important in our guts.

At the very least, in light of all the questions, we should be investing much more effort and money into understanding the effects and into reducing the likelihood of harm from GMO. I fear that Roundup has already done harm to millions and modifying food for the sole purpose of being able to apply higher doses is folly when we don't understand the consequences yet. We just haven't had the chance to test enough.",0,,,2,science
3odpha,8,"I figured the ""study"" you would link would be Seralini's.

A fundamental principle of toxicology is that the dose makes the poison; this goes for anything whether it be glyphosate*, or sugar, or salt, or water--a high enough dose of any will be toxic, the idea is to figure out what that dose is. This principle is exploited when spraying. The idea is that a crop that was sprayed with glyphosate, once on your table, has such an insignificant amount of the residue. You can learn about some of the properties of glyphosate (e.g. NOAEL) here: http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/dienochlor-glyphosate/glyphosate-ext.html
It's often portrayed that these things have not been studied in any detail; this is false.
Anyways, just be careful when saying stuff like, ""We know glyphosate is harmful"" when you don't have any evidence for saying such things. This is misinformation, and it is such a huge problem right now.

3odpha,5,"> 1) Scientific facts are the general consensus of the scientific community on a given topic based on reproducible, falsifiable experiments. (Def)

You really nailed when this is the objectionable part of the proposition.  MUCH, or even a majority, of science that makes it way into all manner of public uses do not meet this level of rigor.
  
A very good illustration is the use of ""bite mark"" identifications in criminal settings.  This type of evidence was the provenance of a very small community of scientists and experts, and so the consensus was not extremely reliable.   Additionally, the expert community opinion was deeply compromised because most of the community had a direct interest in the science being of value, and therefore personally valuable.  Because of it, at one point, almost every published author on the topic had testified on one or the other side of a criminal trial.  Basic rigors like reproduciblity, and falsifiablity, were not followed.

Worse is, even when presented accurately to jurors, jurors lacked the necessary scientific framework to evaluate the evidence as a part of a larger case.  In one famous case, an expert testified that the defendant was the only person in the world who could have left a certain bite mark, but the same lab that commissioned that work later excluded the proposed criminal based on DNA evidence.  In another case, an expert correctly identified that the bite-mark was not a unique individual identifier, but the jury nonetheless expressed that they believed it was.  

When we examine the larger context of the question, it's raises a lot of concerns, since very little of our scientific consensus is ever reproduced.  So saying something is reproducible is based on a supposition that, if actually reproduced, the results would hold. Independent researchers attempting to reproduce even basic experiments are often unable to do so.  Even when no wrongdoing is suspected, perfectly well-meaning practical scientists can suffer from errors that preclude reproduction.  

Finally, you have science that operates outside the realm of experimental rigor.  Global warming et all is at least partially based on the idea that what we are seeing is unprecedented, and therefore, we model behavior, but part of the theory is the results are widely unpredictable.  The lack of reproduciblity is therefore expected.  This presents difficult questions with regards to policy formulation.",0,,,19,science
3odpha,6,"I absolutely agree with all of these criticisms of the argument as presented.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if there's a better definition of scientific fact to operate from.   A few responses, for the sake of the discussion.

The first is what I'll somewhat flippantly call the bad science objection.  This is absolutely a problem, but doesn't necessarily defeat the argument as it stands.  The response would be that the outcomes of those particular subdisciplines have not yet met the criteria for a scientific fact under this definition and therefore may not be the best available information.  The discussion on what is then the next best information available, or how much stock should be put in science that may not fulfill the criteria of the argument would be a fascinating conversation, but one that might severely outclass me.

The objection based on new science is also incredibly thought provoking.  This is territory that's more related to my field, in sort of a backwards way.  I work in music history, and the analogous definition of a historical fact would be something like ""general consensus of the historical community of a given topic on that topic based on identifiable remains of the past and sound interpretations therein.""  With new science, there might be another category of information that combines these two ideas based on available data and the interpretation of it.

Interestingly, by the nature of the beast, new science is the best and only available information on that science.  Climate science is basically the only show in town if you want to get information on global warming.  If we are committed to using the best available information, we're still stuck with this information.  We just have to accept that we need to be flexible as / if the situation changes.  This probably has to be the case with standard-issue science as well, although I think there are deeper issues at play there.",0,,,8,science
3odpha,7,"Thanks for a nice reply.

> The first is what I'll somewhat flippantly call the bad science objection. This is absolutely a problem, but doesn't necessarily defeat the argument as it stands.

I agree it doesn't necessarily defeat the argument, but I think it tends to cast a bad light on the practical application.  Discerning ""bad science"" from ""good science"" is not a straightforward task.  That is also assuming that all parties are acting in good faith.  When you add in bad faith actors, it becomes a challenge even for experts.  

Science and the rating of it becomes a certain pyramid scheme of credentials, stacked higher and higher.  At some point, the general feeling is that the credential stack is high enough, and the science becomes ""acceptable"".  Yet, we have numerous historical examples of extremely grave mistakes being made on the foundation of consensus driven science.

I find it helpful to look at science as three things: a profession, a practice, and a body of knowledge.  When judging the value of science for public policy, I have found it helps to try to eliminate both the profession and practice and focus only on the knowledge aspect of it.  That will help hide the personalities who are starting to outshine the knowledge.  It will also help eliminate the practical portion, which too often is corrupted with money, prestige, publish/perish problems, and other human aspects that are unfortunate.  ",0,,,8,science
3odpha,5,"> Three seems noncontroversial. 

It's slightly more complicated. The ""best information available"" may be very hard to find (evaluate, weigh, etc.). From a 'law and economics' viewpoint, when there are decreasing returns in search, it is only reasonable to keep searching for the additional information as long as the marginal cost of doing so outweigh its benefits. So it may be quite rational **not** to be 'perfectly' informed. 

Of course, this may also help to explain why people may be averse to 'scientific' arguments. ",0,,,3,science

Obesity is now a greater cause of death worldwide than hunger.  So continuing to push cheap calorie abundance as the paramount need in public nutritional health is the last millenium's public health policy.

Now, public nutritional emphasis needs to shift toward getting people off these low nutrient density, high calorie foods and onto more balanced diets.",0,,,5,science
3odpha,4,"I think this brings up an important shift in the way we handle public health. On a global level, ~3 million children under 5 die of starvation every year still. For that reason, it's still important that we continue figuring out how to create infrastructure around the world.

Like you said, obesity isn't just about how much food people eat, it's also about what kinds of food people are eating. In developed nations there is obviously a point at which the amount of a particular crop that is produced dictates what people are influenced to eat (through marketing etc), but people will sell what consumers want to eat. We're clearly at a point already (at least in the U.S.) where it has become so cheap and easy to produce high fructose corn syrup that you are constantly being encouraged to consume tons of it. I think a combination of reducing the costs of producing other foods, and demand for healthier foods from consumers will shape the way we eat a decade from now. 

Unfortunately, convincing the average American (or anyone from other overweight nations) to eat less volume of food, and different foods is going to be a massive hurdle over the next decade. Short of mandated fecal transplants to change people's appetites by force, I don't see a way to fix that problem in a small amount of time. 

Tying this into the topic of farming and crop technology, there should most definitely still be research and advances in staple high calorie foods (for a variety of reasons relating to environmental safety and also optimization of growth conditions etc). There should also be expansion of these efforts into finding a way to produce lower calorie, higher nutrient density crops. If you can make it cheaper, someone will sell it, and marketing is a fantastic way to change what people 'want' to eat. ",0,,,2,science
3odpha,5,"In no way do I want to detract from your very thoughtful reply.  I would like to add to it, though.

> There should also be expansion of these efforts into finding a way to produce lower calorie, higher nutrient density crops. If you can make it cheaper, someone will sell it, and marketing is a fantastic way to change what people 'want' to eat.

I believe that some people who have studied the growing global obesity problem have concluded that the individual consumer's pocketbook decisions in the grocery store have been significantly tilted toward cheap, low nutrient density calories due to grain subsidies and other ways those kinds of crops have become abundant and cheap (including higher crop yields/cheaper farming with GMOs).

The impact of GMOs on grocery store pricing, and how that pricing influences dietary imbalances, should be a matter of public health policy debate if people who promote GMOs argue that they make staple foods cheaper and more abundant.  

Perhaps we can find a way to make these staples more available in markets where hunger is a problem and less available (abundant, cheap) in consumer markets where obesity is an issue.",0,,,3,science
3odpha,6,"I apologize if I wasn't able to properly convey what I was trying to say. 

You said it exactly right. Ideally, the fruits of our existing products shift to the developing world, and future efforts in developed nations shift to focus on reducing the prices of other kinds of foods. If healthier alternatives become cheaper, then it should have a substantial impact on our ability to convince people to start eating healthier. ",0,,,2,science
3odpha,2,"> Or can they make their choices in whichever way they choose?

Yeah, that part I don't really care about.  If people want to be scared of GMO foods and choose not to buy them, then fine, mandate GMO labelling so they can choose, and let them not buy them.  It is not their responsibility to buy products that they don't want to keep my prices low.",0,,,6,science
3odpha,3,"The problem with mandated labeling of GMOs (rather than a voluntary label) is that it gives legitimacy to the unfounded fear. It also becomes a slippery slope of what is or isn't GMO (almost all corn and soy grown in the U.S. is GMO. Since GMO and non-GMO crops get mixed up in processing, then added to pretty much every processed thing we eat... Well then, virtually everything contains some GMO crops to some extent.)

Imagine if the government forced labels detailing the presence of aluminum front and center on every food product. This would create an unnecessary fear and distrust in the public because aluminum is a naturally occurring element that's present in just about everything we eat, and the average person's daily dose will be nowhere near toxic. Mandating labeling to appease one small group of scientifically illiterate people so that they can only eat low-aluminum foods would solve a problem that doesn't exist. Meanwhile, perfectly safe foods will become demonized for having ""high"" aluminum, while distracting from a useful dialogue about something else, like E.coli getting onto produce. ",0,,,11,science

Until one year, I think it was around 2006, they didn't believe us anymore.

This article points out a problem that's been happening more and more in agriculture as the GM war rages on.


AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS ARE PUBLICLY UNDERFUNDED, AND CRIMINALLY SO.

That's the core of the problem. Over the last few decades, at least in the US, Land grant schools (the only ones that can actually run plant breeding programs. Not Plant Science. Plant Breeding) have been systematically gutted because they were seen as not needed. After all, the US is a land of plenty. There's no need to continually update our ability to deal with drought and pestilence, right? Multiple institutions have all but shuttered their programs, or had to fold into other colleges to stay alive.

It's also difficult for plant breeders to get grants in the same way that basic scientists do. NIH or NSF will look at you and ask what your timeline is, and when you say ""Oh, well about 7 to 8 years to released line."" They then throw your application in the garbage. They also wonder why grad students can't complete 4 or 5 plant breeding cycles a year like molecular biologists or plant scientists can.

So what did these public plant breeders do to keep their programs open in the face of general apathy to the public good? They partnered with private companies to keep their projects and work going. Almost everyone I know (including myself FYI) has been touched by corporate funding. Syngenta, Dow, Pioneer, Pepsico, General Mills, Cargill, ADM, Monsanto, Bayer. I know, in my department, at least one person working for each of these companies. There's also a host of smaller companies working out of the public sector.

So when we, the knowledgable experts, with Masters and PhDs and hundreds of papers to our collective name start explaining to the public that GM crops are not what they think they are, and are generally of no more concern than any traditionally bred crop? They want to deny it because we are tainted by the unwashable sin of corporate funding, somewhere in our career. Regardless of what we are doing now, or how we got there, we are a corporate plant speaking on behalf of some BIG. EVIL. CORPORATE. BEHEMOTH.

That's how we got here. Because the public in the US did not invest in public sector advisors in agriculture, and then wonders why agriculture has become a private affair.",0,,,190,science

Not me. Bias and conflict of interest is the smallest of my problems with this stuff although it does exacerbate the real problem. My biggest problem is scientific illiteracy, not on the part of the general public but a large part of the scientific community itself. For example, at different points the article mentions the words 'safe' and 'suspicion'. You combine both ideas when you mention how they are of no more concern than traditionally bred crops. The connotation given the context is that things are safe and we need more people to think that. They also seem to think that suspicion is bad. The problem is that, in science, suspicion is good. Science has a long history of proving itself wrong. You should be pessimistic and assume the worst unless there is overwhelming evidence to say otherwise. In the case of safety, you should assume things are unsafe until they are proven safe. Realize that to do that, your regular old p values and alpha levels aren't going to cut it. You can't, even though a lot of misguided scientists try, say that lack of some arbitrary level of statistical significance means that there is no effect or no difference and therefore things are safe. You need to show statistical power. Until you do, I am going to remain firmly in that 11% of skeptical scientists and tell you you're wrong to your face. By statistical power, I mean more than just a beta level and stuff too. I mean good methodology and background to show that you're barking up the right tree and would see an effect if there was one.

Just by themselves, they couldn't get the project halted, though, so they started a campaign to spread awareness of the issue to the public.

This succeeded. The public started to show up to meeting and ask for this review to occur before continuing with the project. So whoever was in charge finally caved and put it on hold while the scientists did their thing.

So the scientists did their study, and concluded it wouldn't be a problem. The warm water would remain at the top of the lake and wouldn't pose any likely consequences to the local ecosystem; the project can move forward.

~~Accept~~ Except the public stopped listening to the scientists. They kept fighting and making things difficult and preventing the power plant from getting built.

Since there are no available sterile seeds (GMO or otherwise), nor has there ever been nor will there be, this is a non-issue.

There aren't any GMOs that are paired with fertilisers. Plus glyphosate was introduced as it was far less toxic than the pesticides it replaced.

There are thousands of studies on GMOs. The majority are independent. The scientific community has reviewed the evidence and have all separately come to the same conclusion based on that evidence: There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest GMOs are harmful in any way to humans.

>Research surveys on GMO food safety that I've found say things like ""nobody has complained about this food bothering them""

In some cases the new crops may be higher yield but are not as healthy. One specific case I'm aware of is in Bali where fast growing, fertilizer-required white rice has replaced red rice on many farms.

I agree that this is the only solution. For a while I worked for a nonprofit lab that conducted science and engineering safety studies in another domain, which is a big reason that I'm concerned that I don't see evidence of similar processes when it comes to our food supply.

> Why do you expect they won't? There isn't even a proposed biological mechanism that could explain any ill effects.

Aside from the general ""unexpected things can happen when you introduce genes from distant species"" concern, there's quite a bit of speculative concern in the anti-GMO crowd about what happens when you introduce genes that are intended for pest control into a crop. How do we know that these modifications only affect insects and not humans? I don't know how sound some of the arguments are, but I also know that we don't appear to run the kind of long term trials that could determine whether or not there is a potential issue.

To explain myself, what you just effectively said is ""I don't like GMOs, because I don't like patented food."" The problem with this is patents are not limited to GMOs. If the problem is with patents, why target GMOs? It makes no logical sense to single them out. Just like the original objection, about being fearful of their effects on human health, did not make sense in light of the facts.

>People are pushing GMOs almost as hard as vaccines.

This is absolutely a distortion of reality. People push vaccines to make them mandatory for certain public services because this move by the anit-vaxxers (that has been quite effective) has the potential to create a public health crisis.

Is there anyone pushing for GMOs to be put anywhere by the government? I haven't seen this.

What they are doing is pushing back against the strong push to create a de facto ban on them simply because they don't like them, or irrationally fear their affects on health, or because they incorrectly believe they are the only types of food that can be patented. We can claim that it is about ""a right to know"" but it is really about pushing them onto labels so it is easier to convince people there is a reason to treat them differently and organize against them. About 1% of the population has a gluten issue, yet 33% claim that they make an effort to avoid gluten.

> but I'm concerned that private industry will try to co-opt the pro-GMO zeal

What you should also be concerned about is private industry co-opting the anti-GMO zeal among so many people in order to push their agenda through the government. Very few, if anyone, on behalf of GMOs is arguing for some kind of special treatment for them, what they are arguing against is singling them out for no good reason.

What the 'pro-science'\* crowd on reddit too often doesn't seem to understand or acknowledge is that, while there might not be any valid scientific concerns about an issue coming from the community researching the issue, there might very well be valid concerns based on non-scientific considerations (i.e. popular opinion), or valid objections from other scientific disciplines that have a claim on the subject s well.

There's an unpleasant tendency among the scientifically educated posters\** on reddit, which equates ""no valid concerns on some topic from within the field in which the topic is researched"" with ""no valid scientific concerns, period"". 

Similarly, the unjustified identification of ""popular concerns about a subject"" with ""the laymen population doesn't get it again"". In other words, the assumption that *any* popular criticism or worries about a research subject must be due to 'fear-mongering' and scientific illiteracy.

Which is a rather naive perspective, although, understandable to some degree perhaps, because of all the *bunk science* reasons we hear so often (say, on vaccines or climate change). 

Nonetheless, a knee jerk response to dismiss *all* criticism from outside the field isn't the solution, and it can be rather irritating to see this type of response so prominently on top in here.

Farmers are still free to grow whatever non-patented crops they like. But it's just not profitable. Nobody is forcing them to do anything, it's basic economics.

If I cross two plants together, go through additional breeding, and get a nice crop variety, I can patent that hybrid under the [Plant Variety Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_Variety_Protection_Act_of_1970) or a PVP patent. That kind of patent has been around in variations since the 1930s that says other people can't produce seed from this variety for their own breeding for profit, but can only use it produce enough seed to use on their farm next year and sell as foodstuff. That protection lasts for 20 years for me to recoup the costs of going through a breeding program for 7-8 years to get a finalized variety and becomes open use after it expires.

GMOs operate under the same general set of rules. They can also qualify for what's called a utility patent. You can set some additional rules with that, but at the end of the day, the patent still expires in about 20 years.

Basically, patenting crops isn't that big of a deal, and some people think when they first hear crop patents that the company maintains control forever.

>demagogues and anti-science zealots 

This is the product of insular groupthink. GM crops, vaccines and autism, climate science or nuclear power are actually four completely different controversies, they are not just the ""Anti-Science"" vs the ""Science"".  I love nuclear power and I'm glad I live in an area that has more nuclear power than coal - but if somebody tells me they have concerns about the potential of contamination from an accident, however rare - or the need to find storage for nuclear waste for very long periods - those are totally legitimate concerns.  Even if, as I feel I must add as a disclaimer here, I think those concerns are easily compensated for by the benefits.  

Same with GM crops - so much of the debate centers around labeling, which involves many more concepts than just what the science says. I am personally concerned about the precedent it sets for labeling in general if we don't label GMO foods as such just because it's deemed non-harmful - are other ""non-harmful"" ingredients to be removed next?  Do I really need to know that there's sodium benzoate in a soft drink if it means I might irrationally decide not to buy it?  But if I try to make that point I get lumped in with Jenny McCarthy and Rick Perry. Think about how elitist that sounds to someone undecided on the issue.  

This is not how you win a PR battle - by using a tone that suggests you're the only one who could possibly be right about anything, just because you're a scientist.  You have to accept that while you can tell everyone what the science says, that doesn't mean you can then dictate social policy with the same level of authority, or that any legitimate concerns you personally consider small are indicative of being ""anti-science.""",0,,,14,science
3odpha,1,"> I am personally concerned about the precedent it sets for labeling in general if we don't label GMO foods as such just because it's deemed non-harmful - are other ""non-harmful"" ingredients to be removed next?

No, because GMO isn't an ingredient. It's a technology used to create the genetics of the seed. GMO is used to create the seed, and the seed grows corn, and corn is on the ingredient label.

However, your concern about precedents is an interesting one. Generally, mandatory labels are reserved for things that are considered essential health or nutrition information. This is why ingredients and nutritional content is mandatory; because it's essential for the consumer to know to make decisions about their health and nutrition. GMO is neither a health or nutrition factor, any more than the type of soil it was grown in, or the star sign the seeds were planted under. To allow mandatory labels for GMO, despite there being zero health or nutrition factor, for no reason other than some people are curious, means that this sets a precedent that anything can become a mandatory label just because a group of people are curious. This means there is theoretically no end to the list of things that could become mandatory labels.

This is the reason the FDA have given as to why they've said no to it being mandatory. It's currently a voluntary ""verified non-GMO"" that does exactly what's being asked, and appears on over 27,000 products.

3odpha,5,"It certainly is broad, and it's portrayal as anti-science is unfortunate because it's basically as scientific as conventional farming in that they need to carefully plan out crop rotations and other aspects to maintain adequate nutrient levels.

They also talk about nitrate leaching, which is definitely a huge issue (especially along the corn belt down to the Gulf of Mexico) and it looks like organic systems aren't much better as far as runoffs go.

3odpha,6,"Cover crops normally have the effect of reducing nitrate leaching, so I think it's worth noting for the benefit of people who don't want to read the linked study that the year in which they increased it was a drought year in which the organic crops were stunted and unable to fully utilize the nitrogen from the legume cover crop.

3odpha,7,"Hmmm, interesting, I didn't catch that part!  
I wonder if the higher yield for the organic manure system was due to it 'sticking' better to the dry soil? Or maybe the systems being compared were at different points in their rotation?",0,,,1,science
3odpha,8,"It's in the ""crop yields under drought conditions"" subheading. Basically, what happened with the corn grown under the organic legume system that year was that the cover crop soaked up too much of the soil moisture, so the corn underperformed relative to both the organic manure and the conventional systems. 

Both organic systems outperformed the conventional one in soy production during the drought year, again most likely because of higher volumes of water percolating through the soil.

I don't remember if it stated this outright in the study, but both organic systems scored significantly better on measures of soil health such as carbon content and soil biomass, so I assume that's probably what caused the difference in water percolation and retention. In a year with normal rainfall, it wouldn't make a big difference and the conventional crops would outperform the organic ones, as indeed they did. But during drought years, higher soil organic matter content, more earthworms, etc. can make a big difference.

This is one of many reasons why I think the ability of conventional agricultural systems to ""feed the world"" is greatly overstated, especially in regions like the Sahel and the arid parts of India, where droughts are frequent and access to irrigation is poor. Especially with climate change coming down the pipeline, we need to move towards a combined system that includes the best of both organic and conventional worlds. Widespread use of cover cropping would be a good first step - as this study demonstrates, it's not a panacea, but it typically does reduce runoff by a significant degree while increasing soil fertility, biomass, and organic content. Reduced yields in the short term would be a small price to pay for increased resilience in the face of climate change and its associated increased risks of both drought and flood, the effects of which are also mitigated better by soils with high organic matter content and more consistent soil cover than those without.",0,,,1,science

1) Humans don't like being tested on. It's a thing. Large scale manufactured GMOs is essentially a large, long term, experiment. Safe? Probably; but still an experiment. If we're going to do this, there needs to be some written, tangible, and enacted benefits to the community. Not Monsanto promising to make food cheaper or feed the hungry. They're just not going to do that. 

2) Introducing GMOs into the larger population by way of large corporations makes me extremely wary because as a consumer, I have VERY LITTLE trust in 21st century large corporations. No good scientist in their right mind would say something like ""I'm 100% certain"" of anything, let alone their being ""sure"" that there are no unforeseen consequences of allowing corporations the freedom to regulate certain aspects of the food we eat. It's irresponsible to say such things. 

3) Scientists are great at science, but they tend not to be good business people much of the time, and are all too naive sometimes when they allow their good work be manipulated to the ends of industry/media/etc. Then, when things go wrong or not as expected, the traditional excuse becomes, ""we weren't speaking to that point, only to the science"".

Panic ensures, and the field is lost for words because they can't effectively communicate with regular people. Yes, the media is at fault, but science also needs to not put itself in such positions. I feel like if science and scientists want to be leaders in public outreach they have to learn how to SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC in a way that the public understands and isn't filtered through the lens of corporations or media distortions.

patents only last a few years, but even without them the methods of making GMO require a large facility and the regulation on GMO ensure that only a large corporation can afford to make them. but most non-GMOs are like this, the best seeds have to be bought and they lose their potency with each re-planting, so you have to keep buying new seeds. however have a crop that can grow in a third world country, and having the seed money (pun kinda intended) can allow them to make something they can export to buy more seeds.

> Another error often made is saying GM is just like the hotspot mutations and increase/decrease of gene copies that happen in traditional breeding. 

other than being more controlled and precise...what is the difference? if i use GMO to change a gene or selective breeding to get the same gene switched in the same way, other than the time and loss of large numbers of crops, what is the difference?

i think a greater gain for a country is a perfectly fine reason, golden rice for instance doesn't impact the USA because we get plenty of vitamin b, but in countries where they do not it is a great benefit. can't even say these people not dying is a benefit to mankind as a whole, but it's a great benefit to them and their neighbors and family and country. same for GMOs that grow in arid environments.",0,,,1,science

From my understanding, your concern (and that of other ecologists, including several PHD's who I know and have discussed the issue with) is that GMO farming helps strengthen and increase the scale of an already flawed model of agriculture.  The people I've talked to were concerned that large fields of corn dependent on pesticides and synthetic fertilizers to survive would turn  into even larger fields of corn, genetically altered to rely on even greater chemical inputs to survive.  The concern I've heard about this is not unique just to GMO, but rather sees GMO as a tool in the toolbox of big agriculture which can be employed to increase the scale of farming to an even more unsustainable level.

It's the fragility of monoculture from an ecological standpoint, but it's also the loss of habitat that was originally available for other species.  There is also a concern that pesticide-reliant large scale GMO farming could be poisoning other species that aren't ""round-up"" ready.  I've heard reference to bee populations relating to this argument. I have also heard concerns that the way in which large factory farms fail to rotate crops frequently enough is slowly leeching the soil of vital nutrients, and steadily increasing reliance on synthetic ones that have to be mined from elsewhere, perhaps not a sustainable model.

The point I've heard is this not susceptible to the counter that ""well this is a larger concern of big agriculture.""  GMO crops allow big farms to continue and extend these other practices and thus is contributing to the problems I'm raising above.

But we need to eat.  So we try and control how many pests eat our own personal crops.

Now, believe me these companies are just as concerned as you are on how their crops effect nature.  This is why the seeds produced from the plants are all duds.  They can't grow.  Farmers have to buy new seeds.  It is also why they have a shit ton of studies going on and regulatory systems in place to make sure only harmful insects are effected.

3odpha,0,"Real problem with GMO is not the fact of genetic engineering itself, but the purpose of the engineering. In most cases they are engineering plants to withstand enormous amounts of herbicides, that kill non-engineered weeds and those herbicides (like RoundUp/glyphosate) are not safe for any life forms at all because by it's chemical nature it interferes with our biochemistry. The plants that we eat end up being soaked in glyphosate, but are not dying because of the added genetic traits. Glyphosate is ""probable carcinogen"" in Europe and banned in many countries. 

Avoiding glyphosate is harder because we won't get labeling for that, so many people just want to know what food was grown with GMOs as a marker of a glyphosate to avoid it's consumption.",0,,,1,science
3odpha,0,"Another reason why GMO is bad is for sustainability. After a farmer uses GMO seeds he can no longer keep his seeds to grow the next harvest, he has to go buy the seeds from Monsanto. And this is half of the issue, because once all your neighbor farmers plant GMO seeds, your non-GMO seeds get cross-pollinated and Monsanto comes to you accusing you of planting their seeds illegally. This does happen and farmers are forbidden to talk about this as part of their court sentences/deals.

The debate is only partially against science, but mostly about how science is being used to promote corporate interests. Same interests that were adding tetraethyllead to the fuel, when even Romans knew lead was a poison.",0,,,1,science
3odpha,1,"> After a farmer uses GMO seeds he can no longer keep his seeds to grow the next harvest

most farmers do not do this with non-GMO, the first generation seed is the best, and the reason they can't keep them is because anti-gmo folks are afraid of GMOs being allowed to reproduce.

>he has to go buy the seeds from Monsanto

or anyone making GMO seeds.

>because once all your neighbor farmers plant GMO seeds, your non-GMO seeds get cross-pollinated and Monsanto comes to you accusing you of planting their seeds illegally. 

this has literally never happened, also if the seeds are infertile how can they cross pollinate? if they are not infertile what keeps you from replanting them? these two points of yours are contradictory.

>This does happen and farmers are forbidden to talk about this as part of their court sentences/deals.

it has not.

> when even Romans new lead was a poison.

romans did NOT know that lead was a poison...that's why they put it in their food. but when lead was being added to fuel we DID know that SOME forms of lead are poisonous...but not all forms are and the form in fuel was thought to be safe.",0,,,2,science
