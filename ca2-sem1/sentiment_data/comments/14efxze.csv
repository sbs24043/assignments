if you draw a circle, centred in Burma (Myanmar), with a radius of 3,300km... [more people (4.2bn) live _inside_ that circle than outside it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeriepieris_circle)

oh, and despite the fact that global populations have risen _by the billions_ in just the past 100 years or so, that population distribution - inside/outside the circle - has remained a constant for around 3000 years now

why?

primarily, two reasons: land and food

China and India both have massive rivers that cut across easy-to-farm plains - in fact India has more arable land than any other country in the world (China is 4th, behind Russia and the US - oh and pay attention to the Russo-Chinese borders because both Russia and China are - and Russia is very, very nervous)

Judging by e.g. oats - which are very soft flakes in the instant form, but rather hard in the whole grain form.

And the thing with bulgur is that whole grain wheat is parboiled, like parboiled rice, so that some of the nutrients from the bran layer transfer deeper and you can remove the bran but retain some of the nutrients.

this right here

wheat produces something like 4mi calories per acre, while for rice it's more like 11mi - this means for every acre of farmland, wheat can feed around 6 people, while rice can feed 16 people

14efxze,2,"Actually a big deal in the plant world. Thanks for bringing this up.

There's a factorial of traits that will be beneficial. Faster time to flowering will be one, since adequate growing season times will be shrinking with temperature extremes fluctuating.
Disease resistance is going to be important due to degraded soils, which also have minimal microbial diversity, making it much easier for pathogens to emerge.
Heat tolerance will be important, but the huge element is compatible flowering and fertilization in heat. While many plants can handle mildly warmer temperatures, their ability to successfully produce the ""fruit"" will be hugely curtailed.

There's some things we can plan for, and some extremes we will struggle with. You won't be able to grow corn easily that gets flooded. You can't grow tomatoes when the temp hits 50C. It's hard to grow rice of there isn't adequate freshwater available. These are not simple solutions we can design plants to ""muscle through"", but will require an interdisciplinary approach. 

Plant protection (covered canopies), intercropping, faster growing periods to flower, drone-assisted maintenance, and  rotations with other livestock will all be parts of this equation.",0,,,57,science
14efxze,3,"I think drones are going to be huge. We got a DJI Agras T40 at work and it has been a game changer. Less chemicals used, more accurate application, being able to apply in more conditions than a wheeled vehicle... And we are just a seed company.
