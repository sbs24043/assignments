1bxrtew,0,There was a video about the extra growth you get applying “rock dust” to pine forests in Germany I saw at least twenty years ago.  There’s was no place in the world to buy rock dust.,0,,,29,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,1,I think that whole thing was mentioned in the book “Secrets of the Soil”. Some of the stuff is kind of woo-woo but it’s a pretty fascinating read.,0,,,11,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,2,Actual soil science is a neglected research area..,0,,,10,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,3,I’m just fascinated by the whole plants roots are basically our digestive organs turned inside out,0,,,3,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,1,Every mine in the world that extracts minerals from ore has various types of rock crushers. It's one of the more simple technology's around. Every roading company has crushers that can make rock into any size material needed.,0,,,11,EverythingScience

1bxrtew,0,"Note that it matters what type of rock you use:

> [Enhanced Weathering] EW aims to accelerate natural weathering by spreading finely ground silicate rock (typically basalt, a common volcanic rock) onto soil, which speeds up chemical reactions between rocks, water, and air, whilst capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In the natural world, rocks such as basalt absorb CO2 as part of the continuous process of erosion over millions of years. This weathering process can be accelerated by crushing rocks to increase the reactive surface area and allow more CO2 to be absorbed. The dissolved CO2 is stored in soils or washed away into rivers and oceans where it is stored for hundreds of thousands of years. 

>The new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found EW practices had substantial co-benefits to soil health and crop production as a result of increased nutrient availability with rising soil pH and greater nutrient supply released as the basalt minerals dissolve.",0,,,4,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,0,None of the articles about this technique address the cost of crushing that much rock. Anyone know how much energy it would take?,0,,,8,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,1,"Crushers are stoneage technology. I ran a 100 horsepower rotary hammer mill, which produced 15 tonne per hour of 0.5 mm lime dust. The machine was built in 1940. Including extraction, the finished product was about $10 US per tonne. Modern roller mills would be considerably less than that.",0,,,21,EverythingScience

1bxrtew,1,There already is gravel  pits full of crushed rock called crusher dust going un used for anything everywhere.,0,,,1,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,1,"None, since there's already billions of tons of it in Greenland, ready to be used.",0,,,0,EverythingScience

1bxrtew,0,How much carbon does it take to crush the rock?,0,,,2,EverythingScience
1bxrtew,1,"Depends which rock you crush. Limestone would take less energy to crush, but is also going to be less reactive with the carbon. Also the carbon may not remain bound to the limestone.  
Basalt is much stronger and will take more energy to crush, but is highly reactive and will permanently bind up the carbon in a much shorter time frame.",0,,,3,EverythingScience
