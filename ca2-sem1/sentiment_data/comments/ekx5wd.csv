The sulphate gases are a problem..

Also, nuclear wastes half life is inversely proportional to its radioactivity. Nuclear waste with a 1 year half life is dangerous a hell but only for a couple years. Nuclear waste with a 10,000 year half life... is less dangerous then the radioactive red bricks your house may be built out of.

ekx5wd,8,Sure can if you have an EV,0,,,4,science
ekx5wd,8,"Absolutely! With cheap electricity you can even make methane out of CO2, hydrogen and oxygen. You can get the hydrogen/oxygen from splitting water (again only sane to do if you have tons of cheap and abundant electricity, currently hydrogen is often made from reforming natural gas), and make totally carbon neutral methane fuel (Think compressed natural gas/propane, about 130psi to turn it into a liquid with reasonable energy density) and convert existing internal combustion engines to run off it (A somewhat simple retrofit, it exists already for some cars and you can get stock natural gas/propane vehicles, some that can even switch between natural gas and regular gasoline at the flick of a switch. 

Further reforming (Again, energy intensive but doable if you just have a whole ton of cheap energy to throw at the problem) can convert methane into other petrol chemicals well if you want to fuel aircraft/etc with a liquid at 0psi fuel like gasoline or diesel. 

Bonus points: the above can also all be done on wind/solar power, and often it can be ramped up during peak power production and shut off during peak consumption/low production so it could actually be used to balance the grid by only drawing power when its abundant and powering regular vehicles with the energy. 

PS: Making methane outta CO2+Water is the energy equivalent of converting your internal combustion car into an inefficient electric car. Its doable if you have TONS of power to waste, but its a bad idea otherwise, as it is only a method to store energy in the form of turning CO2+Water into methane, then burning it to turn it back into CO2+Water. 

PPS: or you could just get an electric car. But the above proves it can work for long distance journeys, replace existing gasoline infrastructure to keep existing cars on the road, be used for aircraft, boats, etc where EV technology might not be advanced enough.",0,,,3,science

Even if we just take one aspect of it - the radioactive crap that gets randomly dispersed all around the coal power plant - it makes no sense.

The US burns something like 650M metric tonnes of coal. That coal has 1 to 4 ppm of uranium... so at least 650 metric tonne of uranium.

650M tonne of coal, at 24MJ/kg, is 15.6 exajoules (15.6 x 10^18 joules).

650 tonne of uranium, at 80,000,000 MJ/kg, is 52 exajoules (52 x 10^18 joules).

There is literally more energy available in the trace amounts of uranium in the coal - if we could put it in a nuclear reactor - than there is in the coal itself!

ekx5wd,0,"The decommissioning of coal-fired power plants in the continental United States has reduced nearby pollution and its negative impacts on human health and crop yields, according to a new University of California San Diego study.

The findings published this week in Nature Sustainability use the U.S. transition in recent years from coal towards natural gas for electric power generation to study the local impacts of coal-fired unit shutdowns. While the shift from coal to natural gas has reduced carbon dioxide emissions overall, it has also changed local pollution levels at hundreds of areas around the country. In particular, the burning of coal creates particulate matter and ozone in the lower atmosphere—often experienced as “smog” —which can affect humans, plants and regional climate. These pollutants (aerosols, ozone and other compounds) from coal burning can wreak havoc on human health when inhaled, and also have damaging effects on plant life. They also alter local climate by blocking incoming sunlight.

The author, Jennifer Burney, associate professor of environmental science at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, combined data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on electric power generation with satellite and surface measurements from the EPA as well as NASA to gauge changes in local pollution before and after coal-fired unit shut-downs. She also studied changes in county-level mortality rates and crop yields using data from the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

This one thing I can agree with. Not just with nuclear power plants, but any power generation or, in general, subsidized stuff.

But the obvious solution isn't to let the power plant close, but to take it over and operate it as a public utility. That way, the power plant does not need to be profitable, and any operating deficit is still filled from state funds (like subsidies) but it doesn't go to fund CEO salaries, just to provide clean electricity for the region (which is a public benefit compared to closing the power plant and letting for-profit gas power plants cut in).",0,,,3,science

It used to be used in concrete and other applications but since the environmental laws required air scrubbers be installed, all of the toxic chemicals and substances that used to go into the air now go into the ash, so it's now unusable.

i wish there was some sort of system to implement alternative training for coal plant workers instead of shutting the plants down completely. instead of cutting these men and women out of a job (most of which have had the same profession since 16+ years old), there should be programs in place to help transfer coal workers into a different career that way they aren’t left in the dust.

Propping up a dying industry that needs to be taken off life support just to make sure the workers supported by that industry don't have to find a different job is a terrible attitude to have.

Instead, when we decide that a type of job or industry should be left to die we should fund programs to help those that'll be displaced by its death get training for a new job as well as assistance with placement, resume building, job searching. Maybe if as a society we came together and said, this industry must go, but we don't want to leave you high and dry, let's help you find something else, maybe those that fight these deaths so hard will have less of a leg to stand on and as a society we can grow up a bit faster.

ekx5wd,1,"From the paper:

> In addition to CO2, however, the combustion processes that underlie electric power production also produce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Importantly, these co-emissions differ by feedstock and include various precursors of aerosol particulate matter (including respirable particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5μm, PM2.5) and ozone (O3), as well as other harmful substances like carbon monoxide, heavy metals, benzene and other volatile organic compounds, and oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. Although CO2 is long-lived and well-mixed in the atmosphere, and its impacts are therefore independent of where it is emitted, the same is not true for SLCPs. SLCPs typically remain closer to their emissions sources, evolve and interact physically and chemically in the atmosphere, and are known to contribute to a number of local- and regional-scale impacts, including damages to both human health and crop yields. SLCPs also alter the radiative properties of the atmosphere, leading to changes in the atmospheric column temperature profile and surface energy balance that contribute to regional climate changes.

For crops it's mostly acid rain and particulates that decrease productivity. For humans it's mostly particulates, CO, heavy metals, benzene, etc. that decrease quality of life and longevity.",0,,,2,science

ekx5wd,0,"570 million bushels accounts for around 0.29 percent of the yield of those crops over the same period of time. There are lots of reasons why coal should be phased out, but tiny reductions of stupidly abundant set of crops that have there own set of environmental problems isn't one of them. I'm guessing 570 million bushels over ten years just sounds good to people who don't realize the current output of those crops in the US adds up to roughly 200 billion bushels over the same period of time. 

Longer term climate shifts of human cause and the impact that will have on agriculture is a potentially huge issue but local yield decreases in these crops isn't good platform to sell action against fossil fuels to anybody but the locals. I'm guessing damage to native ecosystems is a much bigger issue but is much harder to quantify than agriculture losses since the latter has a ton of readily available data to work with.
