1bfzwrl,0,"Is it possibly to mulch first? (
precision farming) 

1. Mulch
2. Lime
3. Cow shit andnpiss
4. Plow
5. Seed
7. Role
6. Get rid of weeds
7. Fertilize",0,,,17,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"If you harvested or have anything growing on that field you can mulch first.

And plowing only if you have it activeted in the menu and even then only every 3? harvests.
Some guides for PF recommend you turn off Need Plowing for PF, because you get lower environmental score from it.",0,,,7,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,Is it like plowing reduce the till score?,0,,,3,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,Not if you use a direct drill seeder. It apparently negates the penalty,0,,,4,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,3,Correct,0,,,3,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,Are those the correct steps to do for Precision Farming?,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,"For the few percent it gains, I've never seen the mulching and rolling worth it on crops, but then I dont play ultra realistic settings anyway because I find it sucks the enjoyment out of it for me.",0,,,11,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"Once you do anything on a big scale and what to use realistic equipment, a lot of these options go out the window quick. Mulching flat out never used, the quantity of lime needed for large areas is insane, rolling just an unnecessary time vacuum. In the end periodic plowing, seeding/fert with the mod that bypasses the ""needs rolling"" state is best",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,"Yeah thats what i do. Some maps i use seasons and some i dont. But always turn off lime, ignore rolling and mulching. Stones i dont mind.",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,"My steps with the precision farming dlc are the following

1. Lime
2. Plant/seed while fertilizing and rolling with the seedbed reconsolation (can't remember the exact mod name)

I don't care about the 2% I lose because I'm not doing the mulching step.",0,,,5,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"I only lime after every 3rd harvest, ph levels seem fine until then. Should it be every time you seed?",0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,"I don't play using precision farming but I only apply lime when the game says the field needs it, usually every 3rd harvest like you.",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,"I always lime before seeding, so it is easyer to see where to seed. (fields are not squares on my maps...)",0,,,4,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,i advise using courseplay if you aren't super easy to use and you don't need to worry about anything it can handle pretty much any task no matter the field,0,,,1,farmingsimulator

1bfzwrl,0,Oh nice I needed this and I was trying to figure it out.,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,Glad I could help!!,0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,Do I have to use a plow for this? Like would I be able to use a cultivator? Or does it have to be a plow?,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"Not quite sure, I use a plow preferably to the cultivator but it may work your way",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,"Okay
I will try both ways, maybe even modify it for a more cost-effective choice :D",0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,3,Let us know your results!!ðŸ«¡,0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,4,Will do ðŸ«¡,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,Are these steps for base game or PF?,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,Base game!,0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,"Precision farming and weeds are broken. For weeds you should have a small, medium and large growth stage for every type of equipment. For example, plows and supsoilers have no weeds, non-shallow cultivators have small weeds, shallow cultivators, discs and direct drill seeders all jump to medium the next month. Some precision farming issues are using a direct drill seeder negates plowing impact to es, turning a spot sprayer on then off in a field negates impact of using mechanical weeders etc. With that in mind here is my list for the most realistic equipment use (all equipment must be used on entire field) with precision farming.

**Harvest time:** Harvest  
**Harvest time:** Soil sample field if needed  
**Harvest time:** Mulch (Bonus harvest)  
**Harvest time:** Lime if needed  
**Harvest time:** Plow if needed (Produces small stones)  
**Harvest time:** Optional if not plowed - Shallow cultivate or Disk cultivate (Prevents weeds before seeding - Looks only if you don't like seeing weeds in your fields after harvest)  
**Harvest time:** Optional - Roll if shallow cultivated or Disk cultivate or plowed (Removes small stones if plowed, Seed bed - Looks only if you want a seedbed texture without weeds after harvest)  
**Planting time:** Deep cultivate if not plowed (Non shallow cultivator. Produces small stones and ***small weeds*** next month)  
**Planting time:** Optional - Roll (Remove small stones if present to prevent equipment damage)  
**Planting time:** Plant with direct drill seeder (No fertilizer, ES bonus)  
**Planting time:** Roll (Bonus harvest and remove small stones)  
**Planting time + One month:** Spot spray weeds if not plowed (Weeds are small so no lost harvest)  
**Planting time + One month:** Fertilize with nitrogen sensor

In my game if I use a shallow cultivator or disk harrow after harvest there are no weeds but as soon as you seed the next month they jump to medium weeds. Non shallow cultivators are the only tool that will produce small weeds the next month which allows full use of spot sprayers without impact to harvest yield. You could also plow every time then direct seed to negate the impact but if you are going to do that you might as well just disable weeds.",0,,,2,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"Love this effort and information!! Thank you for the reply, this will definitely help some people out that have precision farming!!!ðŸšœ",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,0,Don't forget to weed after you seed/roll (if needed),0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,Won't need to after plowing,0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,"Indeed, but some fields don't need plowing so I only plow if I have to.",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,1,"Might be a little weird but I follow these steps after every harvest so I actually have weeds turned off in the settings, even if not needed lol",0,,,1,farmingsimulator
1bfzwrl,2,"Yeah I was wrong. If you re-plow every time then you don't need to weed. If you just cultivate then you do. 

I generally only plow every 3 harvests if possible. Some crops require plowing every year",0,,,2,farmingsimulator
