9btczj,0,We could always eat the insects. No worries. ,0,,,19,science
9btczj,1,"I'm totally on-board so long as: 

* The bugs are ground up into a fine, indistinct powder/mush and combined with something to hold that powder/mush in the shape of a patty (eggs? gelatin?).

* It tastes good.

* It's cheap.",0,,,2,science
9btczj,0,"Vertical farming anyone? Unless my understanding that that takes place within an enclosure is faulty, that is. ",0,,,6,science
9btczj,1,"Vertical farming is not a magic bullet; it's only beneficial for certain types of crops and certain circumstances. Vertical farming's advantages are control, yield per area, and transport.  However, you are investing way more resources for the setup, making it wholly unsuitable for staple crops like wheat/corn/rice, short of drastic advances in the technology.",0,,,4,science
9btczj,2,"Perhaps if we breed a variety of wheat that has very short shafts and an increased seed growth rate, instead of insect and pesticide resistance.",0,,,2,science
9btczj,3,That's entirely up to the farmers,0,,,2,science
9btczj,0,"That means birds and other animals that eat insects will have lots of food, no?",0,,,3,science
9btczj,1,That doesn't seem to help against locust swarms. Also not all bugs are safe for consumption.,0,,,2,science
9btczj,0,Sounds like it's time to breed bug eaters. ,0,,,4,science
9btczj,1,Like... Humans?,0,,,4,science
9btczj,1,Great way to wreck an eco-system...,0,,,7,science
9btczj,2,"I mean, yes and no. If we have experts manage it well, it's possible it could turn out ok. Look at the wolf breeding programs, they've been of great benefit. We just can't half ass it.",0,,,3,science
9btczj,3,"Let me introduce you to Kudzu, the Japanese beetle and Japanese lady bug....these were also introduced by “experts”  ....also, genetic modification has never back fired, oh, sorry let me also introduce the Killer bee ",0,,,4,science
9btczj,4,Pretty sure this was before scientists understanding of ecosystem destruction. Scientists usually try not to make the same mistake. ,0,,,3,science
9btczj,5,"But things got out of hand because scientists don't always know every possible outcome, and unexpected issues can arise.",0,,,2,science
9btczj,6,I think scientists (I know I used it too) might have been the wrong word because I’m not quite certain if it was scientists or someone less qualified who pushed the idea but the chances of that happening again is unlikely (at least on a professionals level) as research has now been done highlighting how an introduction of animals can cause invasive destruction. ,0,,,0,science
9btczj,0,congrats you discovered bugs. Now how much Government money for research does that get you?,0,,,-1,science
9btczj,0,I always knew the cockroach would take over the planet.,0,,,-1,science
