Somehow i was the asshole for pointing this out and saying statistics is the art of lying with numbers.",0,,,15,farming

51f76x,1,"This article contains links to the original paper it's talking about.  The percentage in the title is actually an average covering all crops in the US, not anything specific.

Organic cotton takes a ~45% yield hit while grain corn takes a ~35% yield hit.  As a cotton farmer, I can tell you that's entirely because of fertilizers.  I grow both GMO and non-GMO cotton and the yield is the same either way.  It's just too hard to get proper fertilization amounts and timing to get equivalent yields without at least some synthetic fertilizer.

FWIW, I use one irrigated field as a no till test plot.  Using a triticale/hairy vetch cover crop, I've been able to reduce fertilizer inputs by 60% and get the same yields.  As time goes on, I may be able to reduce that further but I haven't been doing this long enough yet to get those kinds of results.",0,,,2,farming

51f76x,2,"And you dont feel that was at all an attempt at misrepresenting the yield differences between the two? As i said on that thread, The real yield numbers we were dealing with were 180ish and 110ish. Were you to say to someone that those are 12% different, they would think you a liar or an idiot.",0,,,4,farming
51f76x,3,"After reading the piece again, I can say that I really don't. 
12% isn't in the headline, it's not even in the first half of the article, the sentence is clearly written and directly references that fact that it's a comparison to attainable yield, a number that farmers have achieved and if yield was the sole measure of sustainability would be our goal. 

I see where you a coming from, but it seems to me like his primary motivation for writing it is to illustrate that simply comparing real yield seems natural, but there are other perspectives that are no less mathematically valid. Forcing us to ask why society thinks it's okay to lose 66% of potential yield 'because it's not economical' is okay but another 12% means ""there's no way we can possibly feed the planet"" might not reflect how you like to think about farming but I don't see why it's wrong to bring up. 

If getting high yields are so important for measuring sustainability won't you love the cover issue of national geographic to read ""US Farmers lag potential food output by 66% for bigger paychecks"" (How we can get farmers to stop squandering their acreage and get on board with modern, sustainable methods.)


You won't see that because everyone understands we're making relative decisions based on economic targets. You have a relative economic target, mine is a little different. So if we're going to compare the output of the two, it's reasonable to map the non-economic potential on the spectrum. Comparing a relative value to a relative value has it's place but usually those relative values are placed in the context of a non-relative maximum. 

 If it was in the New Yorker I might agree with you but this is a weed science blog for Industry. He spend more than the first half setting up how the comparison was made and the reasons for doing it that way and the 12% difference was just an understated mention. ",0,,,1,farming
51f76x,4,"I'm not saying 100% that it was the author's intention to directly mislead. Nor that statistics is 100% used to lie or mislead. However, it is easy people with ill intent to use them as such. 

You're intelligent enough to read that article, which was written (i'm guessing) a fair bit above a 12th grade reading level. Perhaps my criticism of statistics stems from what happens when uneducated fucks (and the asshole politicians who pander to them) read something they cant comprehend.",0,,,1,farming

51f76x,2,"I'm always curious as to how long the Organic price premium will last as more producers chase the greater return. Eventually, the per unit price should drop to a point of near equality with conventional grown products.",0,,,6,farming
51f76x,3,"You're approaching the market as if it were rational, which it isn't.  Organic marketers will continue to extract a premium for as long as they can demonize their competition.  It's an emotional sale, not a rational one.",0,,,6,farming
51f76x,4,"The premium to the end user will stay high, I'm talking about on the supply side. Once buyers have multiple possible supply lines, lowest cost will win out. There will be a soft floor of course, but the premium growers have now *will* eventually go down.",0,,,4,farming

51f76x,4,"It's not demonization. It's a completely different business structure.  The only reason it's compared is becuase it is in the same industry but not much else is the same. Our prices are several times that of conventional we are held to a stricter regulatory standard with inspections that cost 5k min every 3 years.   We do not get nearly the same amount of government help. Etc

51f76x,5,"> The only reason it's compared is becuase it is in the same industry but not much else is the same.

It's literally exactly the same, organic is just grown with different inputs.  The end product can be genetically exactly the same.

Organic prices are several times higher than conventional because 1) you can market them as being healthier/greener/whatever-er to uninformed consumers who think that olive green packaging means something is better for them and 2) because they have to be to offset the (generally) lower productivity and higher cull rates of organic production.  You're acting like conventional farms don't have costs, inspections, supplier requirements, etc, which isn't true.",0,,,5,farming
51f76x,6,"Business wise it's not the same.  The products cost more. I can't use synthetic ferts.  They don't cost more just becuase.  You have no idea what you're talking about. And Organic ferts are so high becuase a lot of the stuff is used in many other industries. Especially cosmetic. I've watched the price of blood meal go from 30$ a bag to 70 and a large reason for that increase is becuase Revlon bought huge quantities of it.    It's the same thing just like a Toyota and bmw are the same.  
I never said you didn't have cost. Your the one making stuff up.  Look into starting your own organic farm than get back at my when the cost blow your mind.   ",0,,,-3,farming

51f76x,7,"You're kinda acting like that because organic production costs more to produce you are entitled to a higher price for them. Sorry, thats not how the real business world works.

51f76x,3,"I think the tipping point is going to come once enough acreage switches to organic that pests become a serious issue.  It reminds me of the vaccine debate. 

Right now, in California, the organic acreage is still relatively small compared to conventional. But just like vaccines, once you start to have a large enough group that isn't inoculated, the disease/pest gets out of control. Then you'll see some massive impacts on food supply. ",0,,,3,farming

Honestly I don't care about feeding everyone I care about my bottom line and my customers.   And everyone in this sub will say the same.  So these bs feel good articles are kinda pointless.  We as farmer's arnt getting paid enough to feed the world.",0,,,1,farming
