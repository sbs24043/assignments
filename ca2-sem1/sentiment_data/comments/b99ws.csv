b99ws,1,"Dear pelanderfunk,

There is no food shortage problem in India at all, starvation is.

Just so that you know.",0,,,6,science

b99ws,2,"Dear iwishiwereanalien,

I am fully aware that starvation in India is not the product of poor food production alone. That being said, it is ridiculous to suggest that food production levels don't have a massive effect on food prices and the economy. Blight-resistant potatoes (potatoes are almost never exported, certainly not to the levels that grains are) will yield more and feed more, fruits and vegetables with longer shelf-lives will better withstand India's poor distribution infrastructure, and larger exports of grains help the entire economy. There are valid concerns to some of the multinational corporations' interests in GM crops, but having (well-meaning) luddites perpetuate the irrational fear that GM food is inherently dangerous or akin to ""Frankenstein's Monster"" does not help the situation.",0,,,2,science

b99ws,1,The yield increase is a MYTH ! In reality the yield DECREASES because GM crops are designed to require MORE fertilizer and ofc pesticides. This leaves the soil in such a bad state that LOWER yields are the medium to longer term results. Don't believe the propaganda from companies like Monsanto. These guys are evil.,0,,,2,science

b99ws,3,"Because once you sign the seed contracts, get loans and toss away your heritage seeds, you are screwed and in a vicious cycle. There's all kinds of videos on youtube about GMO cotton in India and how it's driving small farmers into bankruptcy.

b99ws,4,"Roundup is much less toxic, and often cheaper than other herbicides that would be need to be used. Unfortunately, it is a very broad-range herbicide so would kill your crop too. Modifying the plant to be resistant to roundup (a glyphosate herbicide) make a lot of sense.",0,,,1,science

They aren't designed to require more fertilisers, that would be counter-intuitive - but if you over-fertilise non-dwarf varieties, they will lodge and you'll decrease your yield. Modern semi-dwarf varieties don't grow as large so the more fertiliser you put in, the bigger the yield.

b99ws,2,"I say ""may"" only because most of the benefits come from disease resistance, which is obviously dependent on how much the unmodified crop is damaged by disease.

Humans have been genetically modifying crops since the beginning of civilization. The only difference between early artificial selection and today's research is that now we have a much better idea of what we're doing. Your superficial comparison to Frankenstein's Monster reminds me of misguided parents who think that vaccines cause autism.",0,,,7,science
b99ws,3,"I'm split on the issue of GM foods.  I, of course, acknowledge that GM foods are safe for people (barring any theoretical allergy scenario) as well as foreseeability 'safe' for the environment (depending on your definition of safe) and that large biotech corporations, such as Monsanto, rigorously test their products for safety (including environmental toxicity to prevent another DDT type PR disaster) and efficacy.  and then those results are checked again my the government for accuracy and completeness before it ever goes to market.  
  
that being said, i don't understand completely the economic issues surrounding GM foods.  I know that GM seeds cost more (they should given the development costs), and therefore are not? accessible to those who could possibly most benefit from them??  i understand that GM foods potentially produce larger yields for various reasons ...including root-rot-resistance (i used to do PCR on non-GM maize, well it was GM in that it was bred to be resistant, to help identify where the genes for root-rot-resistance are located in the maize genome when i was an undergrad - just thought i'd share that bit of my history there).  
  
anyhoo.  i've heard it is possible cut down on crop destruction due to pests and disease by not mono-cropping.  isn't that a more environmentally friendly/""sustainable"" way to go?  i know third world agriculture is very different from the US's where we have a lot of mostly fertile relatively drought-free land.  does that mean GM is only helpful for the 3rd world?  if so what's the deal with it here in the US?  i think GM foods like ""roundup ready"" are more harmful than helpful (to the environment, i'm sure farmers love it).  while roundup does break down easily in a few days, people do not always apply it according to the label and therefore runoff and other causes of environmental contamination can be an issue.  shouldn't we be reducing the amount of pesticides we use, not making it possible to use even more?  pests are already becoming resistant to BT corn and roundup, right?  sorry i get on tangents... i am more familiar with potential environmental or health risk than economic risks/benefits.. (are GM foods truly as environmentally friendly or at least as environmentally neutral as Monsanto claims? because to me environmental risks mitigate other potential benefits.)
  
what are some pros and cons, economically speaking, of big agro-business like Monsanto?  how do arguments differ when speaking about GM food in the US vs. like, yellow rice in china that prevents blindness in malnourished populations of children?  (you know what i mean?)  
  
This lady came from Monsanto and spoke in one of my Environmental/occupational health classes.  She was also from China.  She swore up and down that without GM foods millions of people would starve and we just couldn't support the world's population without them.  (should we be using GM foods to over-shoot earth's 'natural,' if you will, carrying capacity?)  
  
Monsanto is a business.  they aren't here to do anything but make a profit, right?  i'm not saying it's bad science.  (i know an amazing scientist and medical doctor that worked for Monsanto - she's one of my mentors and favorite people.  she only ever talks about the toxicity of products -or any associated biochemistry/environmental breakdown rate/potential photolysis/etc.- and never political/economic issues, siting that's not her area of expertise.)  it's just, how can they say that what they are doing is altruistic?

b99ws,1,"Not at all. Companies like Monsanto are playing with the entire plant heritage of our planet by introducing genes that do not naturally exist such as suicide genes which prevent plants from seeding.

It happens quite often that the payload genes jump strains/species while the infertility gene doesn't.
