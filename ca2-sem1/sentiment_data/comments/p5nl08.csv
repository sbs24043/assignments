https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/first-irish-study-of-adult-exposure-to-pesticide-glyphosate-1.3503475

The levels detected in the Irish is really really low.

>	NUIG researchers and collaborators from the UK Health and Safety Executive measured glyphosate in urine samples provided by 50 Irish adults to estimate background levels of exposure among this population. Of the samples analysed, 20 per cent had detectable trace levels of glyphosate. Concentrations were more than 1,000 times lower than the “acceptable daily intake” level set by the European Food Safety Authority.

The amount they use on crops is not a huge amount, maybe 3 liters to the hectare. So your average cartoon of milk over a huge area.

The biggest problem here is that if we straight up ban it, we are in line for a huge huge food shortage world wide.

Widely done in the UK also from personal experience as far back as 9 years ago at least.

Edit: This use is even included in the active substance registration (really renewal of registration) for glyphosate at EU level. The pre-harvest interval is 7 days and the crop phase for this type of application is maturity but with a requirement that grain moisture levels at <30%. The remarks for this use are as follows:

""Max. application rate 4.32 kg/ha glyphosate in any 12 month period across use categories, equivalent to the sum of pre-plant, pre-harvest and post-harvest stubble applications Pre-harvest uses in all crops include uses for weed control (higher doses) and harvest aid, sometimes referred to as desiccation 
(lower doses). The critical GAP is the high dose recommended used for weed control.""

>The World Health Organization's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of the weedkiller glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer.

...

>The edits identified by Reuters occurred in the chapter of IARC's review focusing on animal studies. This chapter was important in IARC's assessment of glyphosate, since it was in animal studies that IARC decided there was ""sufficient"" evidence of carcinogenicity.

>One effect of the changes to the draft, reviewed by Reuters in a comparison with the published report, was the removal of multiple scientists' conclusions that their studies had found no link between glyphosate and cancer in laboratory animals.

>In one instance, a fresh statistical analysis was inserted - effectively reversing the original finding of a study being reviewed by IARC.

...

>Numerous national and international agencies have reviewed glyphosate. IARC is the only one to have declared the substance a probable carcinogen. Compared with other agencies, IARC has divulged little about its review process. Until now, it has been nearly impossible to see details, such as draft documents, of how IARC arrived at its decision.

>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that in its assessment of the weedkiller, the scientific decision-making process ""can be traced from start to finish."" Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA's pesticides unit, told Reuters: ""Anyone can go to EFSA's website and review how the assessment evolved over time. So you can see clearly how experts … appraised each and every study and also how comments from the public consultation were incorporated into the scientific thinking.""

>In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency published a full 1,261-page transcript of a three-day scientific advisory panel meeting on its ongoing evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate in December 2016.

>No such record of the deliberations behind IARC's monographs is published.

...

>IARC's assessment that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen is an outlier. In the 40 or so years since the weedkiller first came to the market, glyphosate has been repeatedly scrutinized and judged safe to use.

>A year after IARC issued its evaluation, a joint United Nations and World Health Organization panel reviewed the potential for glyphosate in food to cause cancer in people. It concluded the weedkiller was ""unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.""

>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which first assessed glyphosate in the 1980s and has reviewed it several times since, says it has ""low toxicity for humans."" The European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, which advise the 28 members of the EU, have also assessed glyphosate within the past two years and ruled it safe.

Juries were awarding huge sums to plaintiffs regardless of the evidence. Companies were going to stop producing vaccines because of this. So the US government took vaccine lawsuits out of the normal civil court system because ignorant juries were causing actual damage.

It also happened with breast implant lawsuits. Juries are notoriously stupid. Using jury verdicts to support anything is almost as stupid.

https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/silicone-breast-implant-litigation/2010-05

>Litigation over silicone breast implants started with a bang and ended with a whimper. Lawsuits alleging such harm as cancer and autoimmune disease raked in millions of dollars throughout the 1990s, putting silicone breast implant manufacturers out of business or in danger of bankruptcy. With the assistance of “silicone doctors” who used minimal scientific evidence to support their claims, plaintiffs had stunning success. The wave of silicone breast implant lawsuits **was largely a result of public opinion and aggressive pursuit of lawsuits by plaintiffs’ attorneys—not medical evidence**.

Why? Do you have any comment on the article I linked or not? It's not about doctors being sued. It's about the scientific ignorance of juries when it comes to medical issues.

Because of losses in civil suits.

They settled because they were losing jury trials. They can't trust juries so they decided to cut their losses.

Alleging conspiracy because the science isn't agreeing with preconceived notions (I'm not implying that's what you're doing, but it's elsewhere on this thread) is what climate deniers and anti vaxers do all the time.

I haven't done the maths on what the volume is, but I'd gladly consume an amount of glyphosate equivalent to what would normally be in the food I eat.

Right so you do accept that the biocide glyphosate would cause you harm even at the tiny amount of 1ml yet you're pretending that it's otherwise absolutely harmless and won't cause you any longterm health issues if it's an amount that you're comfortable with consuming over decades.

I didn't say that. You've again shown you don't understand dosage or the breakdown of glyphosate. Glyphosate is proven safe as a herbicide. It's applied to crops and then those crops can safely be consumed later. By the time the crop is on your table it has decomposed from its initial application. 

Not wanting to drink 100sq meters worth of glyphosate doesn't prove anything because I wouldn't eat that much wheat in 6 months. If you get prescribed a 6 month supply of painkillers and take them all in one go you'll OD. That doesn't mean the painkillers were deadly, it means you exceeded the proven safe dose. If you eat bananas you've no doubt over a course of decades eaten a fatal dose of potassium, however it's safe if you don't eat them all in one go. Glyphosate does not bioaccumulate so a safe amount isn't going to cause problems over decades. I hope now you see the fundamental flaw in your analogy
