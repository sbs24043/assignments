1cpfyn1,0,I think if you leave it at full yield for too long it starts to deteriate. You need to early harvest field that are ready.,0,,,2,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,1,"Yeah, I think this is a flaw with the game's mechanics and suggestions as if you do what you're supposed to and harvest, plow and sow in autumn, it appears that you'll have basically no yield. It's weird because the rot mechanic must be intentional.

Edit: I just read the experimental patch notes and it looks like this is being changed so forced early harvesting will no longer be necessary. Great stuff! (Now to wait for it to release on GeForce Now...)",0,,,1,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,0,Iâ€™ve def learned to harvest all crops as soon as they hit 100%.  0 reason to leave them growing as it appears they rot.,0,,,2,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,0,"Yeah when crops grow to 100%  it starts rotting in field after that, it's a bit weird.  
if your crops are at 100% before september, force an early harvest to not lose yield",0,,,1,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,1,"Previously I was plowing/sowing in March, then I changed to letting the workers plow and sow after harvest in Autumn. But if that leads to crops rotting away by the following summer, I think I'll go back to plowing/sowing in March. Easier to load up the farmhouses full of workers at fixed points twice a year (March and September) rather than keep a close eye on individual crops all throughout summer each year and then load them back up again a couple of months later in Autumn.",0,,,2,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,2,I agree,0,,,1,ManorLords
1cpfyn1,0,I think there is something in the latest patch that addresses this.,0,,,1,ManorLords
