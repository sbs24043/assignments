x7xwnr,0,I say hog warsh. My beans did go through drought but they're getting some rain now. I think it'll be fine. TN,0,,,12,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Upstate New York, sold half the herd due to lack of forageâ€¦ but we got three inches of rain yesterday so we will have some regrowth just not enough for this year",0,,,10,farming

Terrible.",0,,,9,farming
x7xwnr,0,Alfalfa in central Utah is normal even with the extreme drought we have been experiencing. Iâ€™ve heard of a few farms that have opted to not grow a percentage of their land because of water shortage. Costs are up because of fertilizer and fuel. We will see what next year brings.,0,,,6,farming
x7xwnr,1,Alfalfa and wheat here in central Washington also look normal. At least where I am.,0,,,4,farming
x7xwnr,0,"My sheep are doing alright, had a bit of an issue with cold and wet spring/summer but it looks good now. Going to send around 700 to slaughter in a week's time",0,,,5,farming
x7xwnr,0,North Georgia.  It just depends on where the rain fell.  Some corn bean fields look good.  Some don't.   But I wouldn't worry about shortages.   If anything prices will just be higher just like everything else,0,,,5,farming
x7xwnr,0,SW Iowa. Got 2 inches of rain from June 1st to August 1st. Yields will be around 150 for corn and 45 for beans compared to 205 and 68 last year,0,,,4,farming
x7xwnr,1,"Ontario Canada and we got no rain since Aug. 3 now, our corn will hopefully still make 180 but I'm guessing beans won't be much over 40 either",0,,,1,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Northern Cali, not an acre of rice planted here for us. Half the typical rice crop has gone unplanted from lack of water.",0,,,4,farming
x7xwnr,1,Former almond farmer from central Cali. Iâ€™m sorry brother,0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,0,Southern Ab and southern BC in Canada  have oddly low water levels. Lots  of swamps and dugouts are completely dry. The hay crops werenâ€™t terrible. We had decent rain but head 400km north or east to sask and they were way late on cereal crops from flooding.,0,,,4,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Its all clickbait, and a localized report from me in south Louisiana wont give you a much better view of food production in the US. Since you asked our Rice crop is down 15%, soybean yield will be average if harvest goes well, sugarcane appears to be slightly better than average.",0,,,7,farming
x7xwnr,0,Yields are going to be all over the place this year as far as your typical grain crops are concerned. There may be a shortage of your specialty crops but nothing that I would be concerned about. Most of the articles I've seen crying about a food shortage are more for pushing climate change than about actual concern for people going hungry.,0,,,9,farming
x7xwnr,0,Itâ€™s not very good,0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Pennsylvania vegetable farmer. Our planting was a little late due to wet ground, but everything is doing pretty well now. We had the normal dry spells through July and August.  We are typically happy to irrigate as most of our disease pressure is from soil splash and wet foliage. Getting the last of about 5/4"" of rain now, our fall crops will be very happy with it but our tomato harvest will take a little dent.",0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Minnesota, seeing how much corn/soy I cab pull out of 7in of rain. Chopping this weekend, high moisture for feed in a week or so, probably hit early shell corn before soy. Crops look better than they have any right to.",0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,1,"MN here as well. Seeing a couple high 80 days this week we could be picking some early corn maybe this weekend or Monday. Corn will probably be 28-30% but we will hammer it through our dryer, because our pigs will need feed. Our yield prediction for corn is looking to be 235-250 at least.",0,,,1,farming
x7xwnr,2,"You must've caught good rains, chopping crew said they were taking a lot of 80-100bu corn out around the area, haven't had our adjusted but I expect to do better than that.",0,,,1,farming
x7xwnr,3,"Weâ€™ve been very very fortunate with rain, we also have a couple of irrigated fields. South central MN here. There were numerous rains that didnâ€™t hit land 20 miles south and north of us multiple times.",0,,,1,farming
x7xwnr,4,"I'm over by the SD border on the ridge, seems the storms either spark up any direction but west of us this year. Had our first rain since the beginning of August on Friday hopefully we can still make use of it.",0,,,1,farming

x7xwnr,0,"East coast of Australia here, best season on record for many, I believe West Australia has also had an excellent growing season. 

Very high soil moisture levels so summer crop prospects look very good.",0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,1,When I went out to mums place in the Grampians last week all the canola was looking good even In those marginal fields that old mates planted for the fuck of it,0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,"North Island New Zealand. Into Spring now and its wet. Our prices for Sheep,beef and dairy look to be good. We had a tough winter after the longest drought of my career but growing good grass now. You have to be an optimist in early spring though right?",0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,0,"East Central NE if it isn't under a center pivot beans for us are going to be 25 , Corn 180. Would expect 60 and 230 to be normal.",0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Northern Ireland here, mainly livestock. Crops did reasonably well. Meat prices are good but feed costs are stupidly high.",0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Northern Germany: had a really good harvest, most of germany not so much from what i hear. 
Worldwide wheat supply will continue to be small (like last year) but nothing to worry about for us in the rich countries.",0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,Central Iowa. 230 corn & 70ish beans. We were a little dry but had several saving rains.,0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,Finland. Maybe the second best yield for some time.,0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,"Southern Tier NY, excellent and early spring, bone dry from memorial day till early august, this has been the norm for 3 years, very wet now in September. Corn yields are going to be way down, I think beans as well. Got below average second hay cutting, third cutting was almost non existent. Ironically vegetables have been doing very well but alot of them are irrigated.",0,,,2,farming

x7xwnr,0,"I don't farm anymore,but my neighbors do,wheat harvest was decent, about 60 bushel to the acre, which in this part of Oklahoma is good,but they tried roughing in soy beans in the wheat stubble and got absolutely no moisture at all. They worked the fields up yesterday and today getting ready to drill wheat again. So not so good. Also lost 600 acre of alfalfa a few years back when the cimarron river flooded.",0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,0,South Florida. production is decent but for our cubic feet should be more.,0,,,3,farming
x7xwnr,1,What are you growing and cubic feet of what are you referring to ?,0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,2,"we grow banded crickets and zophobas morio(think mealworm but bigger with better shelf life and better amino acid to chitin balance). as they are cultivated indoors, cubic feet represents our production space more usefully than square footage.",0,,,2,farming
x7xwnr,3,"Neat

Assuming this for feed for exotic pets ?",0,,,1,farming
x7xwnr,4,"some of it yes, depending on season a lot goes to bait for fishing also , and we are now producing cricket powder that we sell by the # as an ingredient for pet food(it's decent as an additive to chocolates or fried food also, I'm not a big fan of eating whole crickets bc of the texture ). if you want a free sample and you're in the states dm me!",0,,,1,farming
