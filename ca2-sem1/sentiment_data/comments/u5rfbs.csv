u5rfbs,6,"What are you trying to prove? I'm actually confused.

All I said is that using an herb sack while doing an herb run is great.

The best part about this is you're still wrong.  No matter how you slice it, if you use the sack you'll travel to the tool leprechaun less times per run.  You'll travel less tiles.  And spend less time on your herb run.

Also, I think you forgot to think about herb runs when you're not planting 9 of the same seed.",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,7,"you said it's luxurious, which is a huge overstatement  

what's your farming level btw? the stuff your saying is kinda odd, you literally have to run past the farming leprechaun to get *to* the herb patch for most teleports. ie xerics talisman, fally cabbage patch, etc.  

nobody plants multiple herbs in the same run except irons. you're also wasting ticks when you have to empty your herb sack at the bank to clean them.  

you can say what you want but there's a reason no one uses the herb sack for farming; yes, you are a very small minority and no you are not a genius for thinking of it.",0,,,1,2007scape

u5rfbs,4,"Again tbf, the game never teaches you this. You have to actively wiki for it or fiddle with an NPC and ""pay"" to look after the tree but once it's done and then suddenly that same option is to remove it.

It also makes sense to default to clearing the patch yourself as pretty much every non tree patch must be done like this. Even fruit trees you pick the fruit and then immediately can chop it down and dig it up.

Combine that with the fact there is tree roots as an output from digging it up, it feels totally natural to expect that's how it's done.",0,,,7,2007scape
u5rfbs,5,You can pay to have fruit trees removed also.,0,,,2,2007scape

u5rfbs,2,"Post 99 pet grind tho.

Also Tithe was made left click water so it's really ez pz. Hardly sanity ruining at all really. Much less triggering than those darn weeds that happenstances into my patches between pick and plant somehow. Super glad I did it personally. 32m and Groot someday..",0,,,3,2007scape
u5rfbs,3,"Oh trust me, I'm at ~160m farm. I didn't have autoweed for a lot of that. The main reason I did it (and outfit) was purely so farming would be ""done"" when I hit 200m.

Also left click water on tithe is significantly slower on first rotation, so you won't be able to do 25x4 which means you'll spend a lot more time in Tithe. You also still have to use seeds on the patches anyway.

Tithe is boring. I don't think I've ever heard someone say it isn't.",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,4,">30 mins to never rake outside of Miscellanea again tho. It's ez. 

Doesn't have to be optimal.

 Each their own but I recommend it to everyone who actually does herb runs,idk if I was unlucky or what but that happened to me atleast once every 5 runs, and sometimes on seaweed too.. so I was hella happy to get auto weed asap.",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,5,"You may have been spending more time with the patch empty than necessary.

Farm cycles happen every 5 minutes (different timing based on players, used to be universal).

When you empty a herb or seaweed patch etc, you have a 1t delay before you can plant a seed again. So that 0.6s has to fall on the 5 minute growth timer for weeds to happen. Herb runs only take around 5 minutes to begin with, less if you're optimal with them. So it has a chance of occuring about once per herb run, and that chance is reallllllly slim. Seaweed even moreso because there's only 2 patches.

Again if you do heaps of runs you'll see it happen of course. But it's just so minor that I've never seen autoweed as some massive QoL thing like something akin to a rune pouch or fairy rings without a staff etc. 

But it's good it's there as a 30 min grind someone can do if the weeds part of farming bothers them.",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,2,"2 runs of tithe farm is also more than 30 mins lol, its at least 45 or so, more if you're bad at it",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,3,Yeah I always compare with doing tithe with 25x4 method. As when I have done Tithe I've made sure to do it in a way that's spending the least time possible haha,0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,1,In terms of efficiency though there’s no shot this actually saves time. I could probably count on one hand the amount of times weeds have grown back in between the time of me harvesting and then planting something new.,0,,,2,2007scape
u5rfbs,2,saves ur sanity though,0,,,18,2007scape
u5rfbs,3,I’d argue spending like 10 seconds occasionally to grab a rake from leprechaun and rake the single layer of weeds that sometimes grows right after harvesting is better for my sanity than doing more tithe farm,0,,,0,2007scape
u5rfbs,4,different strokes for different folks,0,,,10,2007scape
u5rfbs,4,"Depends on how you farm I think. If you only plant stuff that takes a long time to grow, then you'll probably never be bothered by it. But when you're doing herb runs constantly all day, which is what I was doing, it gets on your nerves so much and the auto-weed reward was well worth it for me.",0,,,3,2007scape
u5rfbs,5,"Herb runs it's incredibly rare. You do the entire herb run in a single weed growth cycle. So it might happen once in a run if it perfectly lines up with the growth cycle.

You also only have 1tick of leeway between finishing harvesting and planting the seed. So the chance is even slimmer. If you're for some reason leaving the patch empty for long periods of time, yeah it will take a while.

Also my farm run setup has consisted of bottomless bucket, rake, spade, seed dinner for nearly a decade. So the time weeds happen it's a 2 second and one extra click inconvenience. 

Tithe is 30 mins of boring inconvenience.",0,,,-1,2007scape
u5rfbs,6,The bucket came out in 2019...,0,,,5,2007scape
u5rfbs,7,Correct. Before then it was a rune pouch with the lunar fertile soil spell. Sorry for not expressing those pedantics for you.,0,,,-2,2007scape
u5rfbs,6,"I wouldn't say it's incredibly rare when I had it happen every other day to me 😅 I did do 99 Farming almost all through herb runs too, so plenty of time to experience it.

I wouldn't keep the rake in my inventory though because the more free inventory slots I had, the quicker I could get my herb runs done.

But yeah, I just found the weeds growing annoying during my herb runs, if you don't mind it, then that's great for you, but I'm glad the auto-weed thing exists and was an option.",0,,,2,2007scape
u5rfbs,7,"I'm glad it's an option too. Always good to have those.

I don't know what your inventory consists of, but very rarely do I get a patch giving me more than 20 or so herbs. Which is what would be needed to fill up my inventory.

And yeh if you do a lot of herb runs per day you'll experience it once a day or so. That 2 second inconvenience was something I was used to before Tithe was a thing. And after trying it upon initial release it didn't exactly draw me in for that and the 2.5% outfit benefit. I've done all of its rewards now, but mainly because I hunt collection log slots and am at ~160m farming, so want farming to be ""done"" when I get to 200m.",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,8,"Ah I would make it so I could farm two patches in an inventory just to optimise my route and herb runs better. Since I did them so much, I thought I would optimise it quite finely to my liking.

And omg I'm gonna have to go back to Tithe Farm because this Elite clue I got requires the hat.. >.<",0,,,1,2007scape
u5rfbs,9,"They added that clue legit the week after I finished my outfit. Felt like it was destiny haha.

But yeh, I don't clear multiple patches. There's no need to as it doesn't speed anything up. I clear limpwurts and immediately replant/compost. Then clear herb and replant / compost, using produce on leprechaun and then off to next patch.",0,,,1,2007scape

u5rfbs,3,50 points for autoweed takes much longer than just 20 minutes no? That's pretty much 2 full runs.,0,,,1,2007scape

u5rfbs,1,"I just learned the harvest/compost trick the other day.


For those who don't know, it can be done at allotment patches that are next to a compost bin. Harvest a single watermelon (or anything that grows in an allotment patch) and then click the ground to stop. Next, click the patch again and before the harvesting animation starts, so about a tick, quickly click and use the melon on the compost bin. Your character will now harvest and place the fruit in the compost bin at the same time, saving a lot of time.",0,,,7,2007scape
