Edit to add link https://www.no-tillfarmer.com/articles/12038-no-tiller-russell-hedrick-breaks-20-year-dryland-corn-yield-record",0,,,53,farming
z1aojr,1,"This is the biggest problem with the term ‚Äúregenerative farming‚Äù. Everything from the simple practice of no till is called regen to the other end of the spectrum where Gabe Brown is is also called regen. Personally, I would not consider no-till while applying 400lbs of N regen.",0,,,46,farming
z1aojr,2,I‚Äôd like to see the financials behind these guys farming for big yields as well.,0,,,19,farming
z1aojr,3,"The article said the yield record was a plot, so if it‚Äôs not field size often economics are not considered",0,,,13,farming
z1aojr,4,"But‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre going to ‚Äúsell‚Äù me a program for higher yields then I want to see the numbers. For example, if I could grow 250 bu for 200 bu and you can grow 400 bu for 375 bu, what‚Äôs the upside for me?",0,,,12,farming
z1aojr,5,Totes,0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,5,"I think the biggest gains come from the amount of money you're *not* spending on fertiliser and equipment and so on.

The problem is that it's going to take a few years to get your soil healthy enough that you can do this, and it takes a good safety net and/or balls to do that. I think most farmers aren't willing or able to risk that.

But the risk's are already taken; soil quantity and quality is slowly depleting, food nutrition is following suit. Farmers are like boiling frogs.

With all the inputs coming from outside the farm, farming has become a subscription service. Farmers and the soil are getting bled dry.",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,6,"I believe in this video the guy from NC says that while the cost is a little more having armor on your soil, increasing water retention, and drought proofing your fields made it worth it.

z1aojr,2,"Russell was featured in Gabe Brown's book as a regen farmer, he worked with Ray and Gabe when he was just getting started.

Edit: I didn't know that there had been an update to the article",0,,,3,farming
z1aojr,2,"Every single AG technique is so dependent on your location that studies (PR stunts) like this have no meaning to such a vast majority of farmers.  First, what‚Äôs the rotation?  Second, what‚Äôs the soil type and growing region?  What if you don‚Äôt have irrigation?  When he says ‚Äúalmost weaned‚Äù of pesticides, etc., does that just mean he used something particularly effective to give the corn a head start?

I agree that all of this is ingenuities though, and the scientific approach to farming that exists nowadays is actually really cool, but I just can‚Äôt stand all of the hype around these ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù rhetoric.",0,,,5,farming
z1aojr,3,That's exactly the opposite of what he talks about in his book. He repeats throughout the book that this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. He's promoting regenerative principles that you're supposed to take and adapt to your region.,0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,2,"No till really only means that your not doing full tillage and are trying to keep some soil cover. Seeding is done using a very narrow slot and most of the ground is left undisturbed. After that targeted use of chemicals, fertilisers and all the rest is fair game.  Terms like regenerative agriculture and conservation agriculture can mean many things to different people but I‚Äôd consider them to be situations where you are building the long term fertility and resilience of your soil.  Adding fertiliser to grow more biomass isn‚Äôt a problem to me if that also means you retain more residue and are actively building the amount of carbon cycling in the soil.",0,,,5,farming
z1aojr,3,"A lot of folks seem to equate ""no till"" with regenerative agriculture, organic farming, permaculture, etc, but it doesn't imply that at all. One of the most common ways to terminate a cover crop before seed drilling is to spray with glyphosate. The main benefit of no till is to maintain soil structure and avoid erosion from wind and water. You don't need to be fully organic for no till to be worth it.",0,,,13,farming
z1aojr,2,"You have the wrong concept of no-till in mind, the technic is about having no revolving the soil and only that , you are commenting about organic systems witch is a totally  different system.",0,,,0,farming
z1aojr,3,"I am a no till farmer so am intimately aware of what it is. My comment was regarding the above article which called no till regenerative, which it is an aspect of regen but on its own I don‚Äôt think should be considered regen. Regenerative ag is also not necessarily organic production. There are farmers who use many regen practices but still use herbicide.",0,,,3,farming
z1aojr,0,"I grow apples for juice and I‚Äôve changed many things on our orchard since I graduated college 7 years ago. 
No till, no herbicides, cover crops. Our trees have been more drought tolerant, better producing, and overall healthier since the change. We still use conventional pesticides but try to use narrow spectrum products whenever we can. 
I think any move towards ‚Äúregen‚Äù ag is a wise move for the long run. Proponents who use data and credible sources are on the right path I think.",0,,,30,farming
z1aojr,1,Do you run animals through your orchard?,0,,,5,farming
z1aojr,2,"No we don‚Äôt. I started to consider it this fall actually. I don‚Äôt think it would be feasible since 1. There aren‚Äôt many livestock operations around my area. 2. I think having cattle would break a lot of our trees/limbs. Goats would eat the buds off of our new growth. That leaves sheep or poultry. Sheep would be good but I don‚Äôt know of any shepherds, herds near me. 
Poultry would be welcome. I‚Äôm unsure how they would be penned in. There‚Äôs no fence around our property",0,,,5,farming
z1aojr,3,"Thanks for the response.  What's your ""clean up process"" -- what do you do with windfall and other excess apples?  

Mark Shepard uses pigs and rotates them through his orchard space through the harvest season, they clean up everything on the ground.  He puts rings in their noses to lessen their rooting and he sells them off at the end of the year.  Might be an option or at least interesting to read about.  

In my personal experience, our chickens and pigs are kept in pretty easily by movable electric netting such as Premier1 sells.  Obviously, I don't know your acreage so I don't know if that is as feasible for you to use... But maybe it gives a direction to look into if you haven't already!",0,,,4,farming
z1aojr,4,"We usually prune and then use a shredder to mulch the ground. The juice from the fruit is good for beneficial fungi I‚Äôve read. 
That‚Äôs very interesting. I read into using pigs with orchard. We don‚Äôt have a lot of space for pics but chickens or ducks may be feasible. Thanks for the ideas! I‚Äôll check out the electric netting",0,,,3,farming
z1aojr,3,"Just because I know sheep; if you can you should aim at some lowland English breeds, best of all Shropshire, but even Oxford down. They only take the grass and nothing else, hence why they are often used in very delicate environments (man made. For natural environments it's another matter).
I hope you find some help!",0,,,3,farming
z1aojr,4,"That‚Äôs excellent information. I‚Äôll save your comment in case we ever do go down that path. Thanks!
I had a thought to reach out to our local FFA/4H. You think they would be interested in coming to do some grazing?",0,,,2,farming

I'm not so sure what FFA/4H is however, since I live in Europe :/
I do know sheep though, so feel free to ask something else, if you wish",0,,,2,farming

Great groups! 
Thanks for the open invitation to ask üëç. I appreciate that",0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,7,"Ah I see, interesting and useful initiative!
I guess we could do with some of that over here as well, farmers are becoming an endangered species nowadays...",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,1,I‚Äôm not sure how ‚Äútill‚Äù applies on an orchard.  What would you be tilling and why?,0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,2,"The old timers do it religiously still. They do it as weed control and say that the weeds will compete with the trees, especially young plantings, for nutrients. They also say that the weeds will use the water in the soil that‚Äôs meant for the trees. 
I think they are incorrect",0,,,7,farming
z1aojr,0,"Livestock and grazing is the easiest way to build organic matter and get off herbicides, insecticides and fungicides without losing too much productivity and still being profitable. And if the rotation is long enough a cash crop can be grown without too many problems.  He acknowledges that a winter freeze is also very beneficial to his system because it help preserve organic matter and acts as a final weed kill for the year which along with grazing lets him get on top of weed seed set. Generally grass dominated pasture will provide the most organic carbon improvement as long as good grazing management is used.  But pasture legumes would be needed as well.

What helps his cause as much as anything is that he has some of the most naturally fertile soil on the planet. It‚Äôs not all about nitrogen. Nitrogen can be got free from the air. There are incredibly productive pasture legumes that can fix a lot of nitrogen and depending on your cropping intensity it can be enough for a reasonable yield during that phase. But that landscape also has insane amounts of phosphorus, potassium and all the other macro and micro nutrients. Once he got his biological systems going he‚Äôs growing pretty heathy plants with a good nutrient pool to support. I still wonder if he adds any amendments at all to cover the loss of these other nutrients with any plant and animal exports because if not he will be slowly mining the soil.",0,,,16,farming

z1aojr,2,Even better if feed lots cease to exist.,0,,,10,farming
z1aojr,2,"Out here in northeast us, many livestock farmers finish on hay. However, that's relatively small scale operations. The big dairy operations feed a lot of silage",0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,2,"If you're buying corn or selling animals to a finisher, yes you're helping drive monofarming and feedlots. But there's nothing inherently wrong with corn itself as a crop - and if you're growing it and finishing cattle yourself, you can do more regenerative practices with it.

The most interesting one I've heard is one Minnesota farmer took 3 sisters to the extreme. Twin row planting, 6"" apart, 60"" on center,  Same plant population as a normal 30"" field. Between rows, now with a lot more sunlight hitting the ground, he's planting a 6 or 7 variety cover crop mix. No fert or spray, and his yield has leveled with conventional, and he's planting corn on corn, by alternating where his twin rows are. He's also planting small pumpkins, gourds, and squash in one section as a bonus crop. It's something I'm going to try in 2023 with sweetcorn.",0,,,1,farming

Dirt to Soil is required reading for the students and while I've heard Gabe speak, I had never read the book. I've been powering along with the students on it and while it is a great introductory book to alternative ag management, the vast majority of his system and practices appear to be the work of other people.

z1aojr,0,"I've toured his farm and spoken with him directly. It really is something to see. He is quite open about sometimes using inputs, herbicides, needing to till etc. But he says he does these things far less. I believe him. Great looking soil, great looking crops, great ranges with shitloads of biodiversity. There is a lot of really impressive ag research coming out of that region- [Kevin Sedivec](https://www.ndsu.edu/snrs/people/faculty/kevin_sedivec/) is the NDSU extension specialist doing some impressive work with conservation and rotation grazing.

As for definitions around ""regen"" farming... it's a catch all term. Every location is going to have different needs and require different strategies. I'm finding that most progressive ag research results into ""sustainable"" techniques are leaning hard into avoiding routines and diversifying practices. The biggest barrier is getting people to adopt.

Edit- remembered the guys name finally",0,,,10,farming
z1aojr,0,"Yeah there's plenty of ways to do regenerative farming and we personally use very little pesticides and herbicides essentially only using them on our corn and we regularly rotate crops, plant cover crops as winter green manure, and add coe fertilizer and the occasional load of phosphorus or human waste",0,,,6,farming
z1aojr,0,"I love gabe, he has the proof on his own farm, and that‚Äôs the most scientific way to go about it, the results speak for themselves. regenerative has to be the way, you can not continue farming when the soil is completely depleted, and that‚Äôs what is happening right now.",0,,,4,farming

I think its the time it takes to get there that keeps many from even trying.  The friends that I have that are farmers start off in debt for hundreds of thousands to millions.  You cant take a gamble with an overhead like that.  At the same time, we are gambling by doing something that is so obviously harmful to our environment.

z1aojr,0,"I grow stuff on a very small plot, but I work with a lot of larger farmers who implement practices like this. There are large grants available to help farmers do this as well.

The overarching theme I see on the regular is how no-till (or very low till), diversified cover cropping, etc. incredibly improve soil - water infiltration rates and holding capacity, microbial activity, field temperatures, nutrient fixing/retention, beneficial insects, etc. 

It's a total ""trust me, bro"", but I know many farmers in drought areas who could cut back on irrigation, and others who have actually eliminated some pesticide sprays because they just didn't need it anymore.",0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,1,"I‚Äôd love to know how they eliminate pesticides; our alfalfa fields are either no-till or minimally tilled, we‚Äôve planted cover crops between rotations, the fields are sheeped off in the fall (grazed off by sheep), and we‚Äôre still having to spray for aphids, weevils, and thrips once or even twice per season. Not to mention voles and mice, that can decimate a hay field over the winter. We‚Äôre continuing with biologicals (owl boxes, dumping dead animals to attract coyotes and ravens), but the bottom line is if we want a hay crop, we have to use pesticides and rodenticide, and if there‚Äôs no crop, we can‚Äôt keep farming. 

We‚Äôve talked to Gabe, and some of the other no-till, regen guys. I like their ideas, and we‚Äôre continuing to implement them where we can, but our ground has to be profitable too. Otherwise we‚Äôre selling out and looking for a McDonald‚Äôs job‚Ä¶",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,2,"I guess a key piece of info here is that these were in permanent crops. And they didn't eliminate all their sprays for all pests. But a regular mite spray a few times a season was able to be eliminated entirely. The other ones (for other pests, like thrips or a worm) were simply cut back (say, from 3x to once, or twice to once), but definitely still used. 

Other stuff like preventing dust in the field cut back on some disease pressures. 

Ground definitely has to be profitable, and farming in general is in the thick of the ""alright, how do we makes this all work together so everybody wins"" phase. And, it's a very, very challenging one.",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,0,"My 2 cents is that regenerative Ag practices and soil health will increasingly become a competitive advantage in the long term. If strictly thinking profit/acre, then the ability to grow 200+ bushel/acre corn without any (or significantly reduced) N inputs is a major game changer. Future unstable input costs and weather variability is only going to make this more relevant. 

It still has to pencil out in the short-term though. I think Gabe's (and other's) systems is a good goal, but it takes many small baby steps to get there. You gotta start building up your soil health before cutting inputs significantly. Lots of great resources on Youtube (Young Red Angus, John Kempf, Derek & Tannis Axten, etc.).",0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,0,"I live near the Brown ranch and have taken student groups out there. The operation is very successful. This is what I stress to students - regardless of if you want to run your operation how they do, they're making money. They are currently selling 85/15 ground beef for just under 10/lb. They are successful, they're making money. In the winter they bale graze only land they own so the money they're spending on hay has some benefit on the ground they own.

Is this a model for ag everywhere? Probably not. That being said, what % of folks these days are involved in Ag? We should be banding together, not tearing each other down. 

Every operation is different, and the Brown ranch does own a big stake in a local federally inspected processing plant, so they're able to direct market retail cuts.

z1aojr,0,At the end of the day you can‚Äôt pull more out of the land than you put into it. I think thats why you see these regen livestock farms buying feed to supplement their cattle. Without doing so I don‚Äôt see how you sustainably keep it going. You have to replace the organic matter ( hundreds of pounds of beef per acre) being pulled off the land each year. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.,0,,,0,farming
z1aojr,1,"What you're missing is that the carbon in plant mass comes from the air and not from the soil. If you grow nitrogen fixing cover crops the nitrogen is also replenished from the atmosphere (78% of the air we breathe is nitrogen). In some soils you may need to replenish phosphorous, but most soils have enough available if the correct microbes are present to make it usable by plants.",0,,,2,farming
z1aojr,2,I can understand nitrogen. How about all the other elements that are mined out ? How are they supposed to be replaced ?,0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,3,"Nearly all necessary elements exist in the soil in forms plants are unable to use. The complex interactions of mycelium, microbes, and myriad other soil organisms convert these elements into forms available to plant roots. Tilling and chemical application (especially soluble nitrogen) kills these soil organisms, meaning you now have to provide those micro nutrients as they are no longer being produced in the soil. 

I guess it's possible some particular element literally doesn't exist in your fields due to the geologic history of the area, but that's certainly the exception and not the rule.",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,4,"Phosphorus for sure as you mentioned. Nearly non existent in our area naturally. If the whole system was closed loop and you were still harvesting a commodity off of the land, it wouldn‚Äôt eventually run out of ‚Äúgas‚Äù at some point ?",0,,,2,farming

z1aojr,0,"Also it is about knowing your land. We started no till in the 90s. But have started strip tilling for corn. Try to keep a consistent rotation between wheat corn and beans. Occasionally we will plant intermediate wheat grass or crested wheat grass.

We occasionally plant cover crops, but don't use it much except for some winter grazing in a few spots. Conserving moisture is often a concern for us and in a dry year fields that had cover crops were consistently out preformed. This year we are so dry the cover crops didn't amount to much.",0,,,1,farming
z1aojr,0,It's the future of farming but what Gabe Brown does has to be tweaked for individual areas.
