q9kr9c,1,"Dumb question, but is it common for a lot of Farmers to fail? 

How did you first get into farming?",0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,2,The numbers of farmers is decreasing every year. I think the best answer is they get creative. Also having a plan in place before is the best but not always doable.,0,,,12,farming
q9kr9c,2,"It is very common.

A lot of us were born into it. Speaking of my own family, if it wasn’t for crop insurance we would have been out of business a long time ago.",0,,,8,farming
q9kr9c,2,The last 3/6 years in my area have been declared agriculture’s disasters. It’s rough and I’ve seen a lot of land trade hands,0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,2,">is it common for a lot of Farmers to fail?

They wouldn't be in business if they failed very often, but sometimes you get a bad year. Like 2020 in britain; wet when it should have been dry, so planting was late. Then dry when it should have been wet, so anything that DID go into the ground didn't get enough water.",0,,,6,farming
q9kr9c,2,"It is. Just like other businesses, some manage the business well and others don't. Good years they invest in the farm and make it more resilient while some spend it all on things that don't add value. When the bad years come, they lose it and the ones that invested well may buy them out or someone else comes along and buys it up. It's simply managing inputs and outputs and not overextending the business to where it fails.

Happens every so often here; has for the past 70 years or so.",0,,,2,farming
q9kr9c,0,"With us you basically assume there will be bad years. Like everybody says, you hit savings, take loans, etc. 

Many who farm have outside jobs for some extra income and insurance.",0,,,7,farming
q9kr9c,1,Is it that profitable to make up for the bad years?,0,,,1,farming
q9kr9c,2,"Depends how bad it is and how much savings you have and the outside income. The bigger places can weather more years. A couple of total loss years can really hurt. It is very up and down. Mentally it can be quite stressful and you had better prepare for bad years because they will happen. You become very thrifty with spending. 

You also have to remember that there is huge expense and time commitment just to grow something that might never sell. Sure you lose the profit from the sale but you also have spent a ton of money just to make no money. You can’t give back or not pay for all the seed, fertilizer, chemicals, labor, rent, equipment payments and repair, irrigation, taxes etc. Those bills all come due, income or not. 

Consider going to your job and working all year for an uncertain payday. You get to the end of the year and the boss says we have no profit so you get no pay *and* since we have a loss here is your portion of the bills. That is what it is like.",0,,,1,farming
q9kr9c,3,"Right, but is it profitable in the good years? Like I’m trying to imagine how anyone would choose that for a life unless the good years were killer. I imagine that the lifestyle itself is rewarding but...gotta make some mad coin in the good years to make it bearable, no?",0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,4,"For many it is the lifestyle. Me included. If by mad coin you mean hundreds of thousands or even millions that is not the reality. Not even close. 

Often a job at Amazon or Walmart might have been a better deal. I gave up a corporate job that was killing me for this life. Huge pay cut but worth it. 

There is a famous youtube farmer with 10’s of thousands of acres who says he makes more with Youtube profits than farming. I don’t doubt it for a second.",0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,4,">gotta make some mad coin in the good years to make it bearable, no?

In the long run, these are the ones that leave the lifestyle. You've got to love it or at least be willing to never quit in order to stay. I'm not gatekeeping, it's just the reality of it for now and has been for a long time.",0,,,2,farming
q9kr9c,5,Seems like you gotta be a pretty hard scrabble person who likes work for work.,0,,,2,farming
q9kr9c,0,"Depending where you are and the why you can get crop insurance. It's not enough to live on but it will cover enough of the bills you don't lose the farm. Here it's subsidized by the government so we only pay a third of the cost so to me it's a no brainer. You'll still need to dip into savings, lines of credit, maybe talk to the bank, work out or sell out and go broke. I know 2012 was a damn hard year here. We combined corn with the flex head and at 36 bushels an acre it was a better crop than some. Thing is it wasn't that year that broke guys. 2013 was a washout. Better than 2012 but still horrible. That year was when people went working out west to make payments. Ploughing on the pipelines, working rigs and just working out. It was tough but some made it through",0,,,7,farming
q9kr9c,0,"I'm in NZ and the two things that mostly cause farmers strife are drought and a sudden collapse in prices.

The most at risk are new entrants into the industry and people who have a lot of debt relative to equity.

For most farmers, one bad year means they cut expenses to the bone (both farm and personal) and might have to draw down a bit more equity from their property. The banks are pretty good about allowing that if it's a solid business just going through a bad patch.

It can get a bit more desperate for people with a lot of debt. Many will get work off farm (especially if it's a drought and you've had to sell most of your livestock). In bad droughts there is a little bit of government assistance available, and there's often feed drives -farmers will donate feed to send to drought stricken areas. Neighbours help each other, I've heard of food parcels being dropped off on porches.

Mostly it's about risk management and paying down debt during the good years, although saying that sometimes the only way to get started is to take on a lot of debt and hope it all works out.",0,,,6,farming
q9kr9c,0,Bank overdraft.  But then we cut spending on things we don't need.  Small towns usually find it tough going when farmers stop spending,0,,,4,farming
q9kr9c,0,"Federal crop insurance (mandatory for corn and soybeans + is partially subsidized) has an income protection setup where you get guaranteed a certain $/ acre based on proven yields, market prices, and the level of coverage you pick. I've never had to use it but it's nice to have that option just in case things go tits up. Otherwise you just carry over profits from good years to cover the slow years",0,,,5,farming
q9kr9c,1,Do you know why it’s federally mandated? Basically so if a lot of corn/soybean farmers have a bad year or two they don’t just close shop and decrease the supply by that much?,0,,,1,farming
q9kr9c,2,"Yeah I suppose keeping supply protected is part of it. Although there are always people waiting around to gobble up land if it becomes available, but then you just end up with larger and larger farms, even more than the trajectory we are on now. But yeah I think food supply stability is a major factor",0,,,1,farming
q9kr9c,0,I just went into debt lol,0,,,4,farming
q9kr9c,0,Something I would like to mention is that depending on the type of farmer you are you also may work a normal full time job. Most modern farmers that I know that only do row crop will have off farm income to assist during the bad seasons. Not only that but with the increasing cost of health insurance it’s almost a necessity to have someone in the family working a job that can provide some-type of supplemental income as well as health insurance.,0,,,4,farming
q9kr9c,1,In my area I actually don’t know anyone who DOESNT have a job in town.,0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,2,Conversely it’s very rare in my area for a farmer to have another job.,0,,,2,farming
q9kr9c,3,Same.,0,,,1,farming
q9kr9c,0,"The area I'm in everyone has at least someone in the household with an outside job and/or some tourist income. 

We don't have to worry about health insurance here but it's still sensible to have some sort of financial buffer.",0,,,4,farming
q9kr9c,0,Farmers can also purchase crop insurance just in case of a crop failure.,0,,,3,farming
q9kr9c,0,"In 20+ years of farming I've never ""lost"" money. You'll have years where you barely break even as far as paying back your inputs. But you'll gain back your loses on tax savings. Biggest consumer of revenue is taxes and insurance. There are ways to manipulate each.",0,,,5,farming
q9kr9c,0,My solution wife has a real good job. And I’m very diversified.  Hay has been terrible 2 year running. Drought last year and way way too wet this year. But enough to cover bills.,0,,,1,farming
