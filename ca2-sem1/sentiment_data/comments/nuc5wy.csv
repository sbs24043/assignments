nuc5wy,0,"people always ask how they can help fight climate change and whatnot and here is an easy one. 

if everyone who had space invested small amounts of time and effort into not just gardening, but permaculture food forests and companion planting, we could effect more resiliency of local food sources, stimulation native ecosystems, and a weakening of the industrial mono food system that is literally causing an obesity epidemic, a sugar junkie social system, and constant-cardiovascular related health disorders. 

if we took these steps it would also include eating better, exercising more, and contributing less to the human global problem of greenhouse gas production. 

some people have lots of space. lets figure out how to enrich communities together. 

how can we use science to drive this social change? awareness is not enough. what are the next steps for us?",0,,,65,science
nuc5wy,1,Over 75% of farmland is used for animal feed operations.. reduced meat consumption to help reduce farmland needed for food and we can enable rewilding,0,,,17,science
nuc5wy,2,"This is not true. 

60% of all agricultural land in the world is marginal land, meaning you can't grow crops for human consumption there. The only food production feasible on this land is ruminant live stock as they can eat crops that are able to grow there.

84% of all livestock feed across all species is non-human edible. 16% of all feed is human edible, but the vast majority of that goes into poultry and pigs because they are monogastric animals. The vast majority of what we feed to ruminant livestock throughout the world, well over 90%, is non-human edible.

nuc5wy,3,"Can you please clarify how your sources back up the claims you're making? The world bank source says nothing about animal agriculture or arable land at all unless I'm missing something, and the science direct article is locked behind a paywall but from the highlights/abstract there are a couple of problems with the claim. First, that 86% is measured in weight, not calories. We should be looking at the proportion that we feed them in calories since calories are what's important in fattening them up for slaughter. Second, the science direct article states that livestock consume 1/3 of global cereal production and use 40% of the arable land. To me these numbers still seem to indicate that reducing meat consumption is still immensely effective at reducing our agricultural footprint on the environment. After all, we do not need to use all land - arable or not - for food production and we should try to reduce our land use as much as practicable to restore the healthy natural environments.",0,,,7,science
nuc5wy,4,"The first source you are referring to simply states the amount of agricultural land and amount of arable land. You have to search the two terms in order to find the numbers. Simple math then shows 60% of agricultural land is marginal (or not arable).

About the 86% number; it was simply to show that the vast majority of what we feed animals isn't edible to humans which some people have been misinformed about.

And to your second point; I'm gonna answer this with a more speculative approach, although there are lots of sources for some of my claims but none that bind it all together. Yes, some edible food and arable land goes into animal agriculture, so there's definitely improvements to be made. And one way is to reduce meat consumption. Another is having less monogastric animals, like birds and poultry, that require food sources other than grass or other naturally occurring plants. Focusing on pasture raised, grass fed, grazing animals, not only frees us from producing unnecessary animal feed and frees up land, but it also improves soil quality and bio diversity (through stomping and manure), which has been the cycle of nature for millions of years through wild, herding animals (that we humans pretty much have run down into extinction). Animals are part of a carbon cycle that does not add carbon into the cycle like fossil fuels does (which makes the animal carbon footprint seem small). In fact, an increase in soil quality, through animal herds, will make the soil able to store more carbon thus helping fight climate change. The problem isn't really the animals, but it's how we do it, with factory farming, chemical fertilizer, mono cropping, etc. The future is regenerative, organic farming with gracing animals mimicking wild animal herds.",0,,,7,science
nuc5wy,3,"Yeah, but you could change that non-edible food into edible food by processing it differently, e.g. the nixtemalization of field corn. Better yet, plant different crops.",0,,,1,science
nuc5wy,4,"That’s not the point of their statement. They said that most agricultural land cannot grow the crops we eat, so they grow other things that will grow there (which we can’t eat) and feed that to livestock.",0,,,-1,science
nuc5wy,5,"Correct. And my point is that a large portion of the usable land is going to that inefficient use (meat feed). We could use the farmland for more plant based foods that people can eat, and then we use the unfarmable land for things other than livestock, or not at all.",0,,,3,science
nuc5wy,6,Not at all sounds good.. rewilding is absolutely necessary to allow ecosystemw reocvery,0,,,2,science
nuc5wy,6,"The point was that farmland that you’re saying should be used for people food instead of livestock food, can’t be used to grow people food (at least not right now due to soil quality).",0,,,1,science
nuc5wy,7,"I promise you, I understand what you are trying to say. I think you are still missing MY point, though. 

A huge portion of farmland that CAN be used for edible food is instead being used for livestock feed. If you used this land for edible crops than you wouldn't even need to use the land that can currently be only used for livestock feed. This is because people would be fed by the correct type of utilization and the livestock simply wouldn't exist. Then the land that is currently being used for livestock feed would not be used AT ALL. 

Do you see what I'm saying? 

Additionally, as I said in my first comment, many of those crops that you are saying cannot be used to feed humans actually can. They just need to be processed differently.",0,,,1,science

nuc5wy,1,"Yes to this!! We can vote now with our dollars to support small regenerative farmers who are out there doing the work for our soil!! Every time I buy meat or vegetables I am either giving my dollars to industrialized ag or local soil heroes. I try to make it the latter as much as possible! 

Also, compost or find a local farm that will compost for you! Grow food and local perennial plants instead of an immaculate lawn if you have a yard. Etc etc etc",0,,,2,science

nuc5wy,0,What does it ultimately mean for the nutritional content of the fruit/vegetable we eat? Is there a significant difference yet?,0,,,3,science
nuc5wy,1,"Yes, although many people will say no. There are many micronutrients that don't exist in commercial crop soil. Farmers use the bare minimum fertilizer to grow crops in commercial production.",0,,,5,science
nuc5wy,2,"This isn't true at all.  Its a dubious claim at best to say that micronutrients in soil directly translate to micronutrients in a crop. 

More importantly, farmers use *too much* fertilizer. For chemical fertilizers, its too cheap not to. For organic sources, it is not well qualified. And in both cases its easier to add too much than not enough when yields and subsidies are priced like they are. 

Its monoculture and tilling that are the biggest problems here. Fertilizer is an entirely different beast- and we see its worst impact in our water quality and fisheries.",0,,,6,science
nuc5wy,3,"My point is that if the micronutrients aren't in the soil, you definitely won't have them in the crops.",0,,,3,science
nuc5wy,4,"Yea, I guess that sounds right to me, naively. I know sulfur as a micronutrient additive is getting to be more mainstream.

I was more addressing the ""farmers use the bare minimum of fertilizer"" part. I wish what you were saying was true... would make agricultural GHG more tolerable.",0,,,2,science
nuc5wy,2,"Also crops have been bred for size, uniformity, and yields, not nutritional content. We have been size queens on fruits and veg for way too long. You can restore nutrition to the soil but the crops that absorb it into usable forms are less prevalent. 

GMOs sought to try to have the best of both worlds, but they got a bad wrap on some failures of oversight which are totally avoidable now. Also people are so afraid of foreign plants that we don’t realize we already use some in crop rotations but don’t consider them “foreign”. Foreign plants can help in crop rotation and soil/land development, we need to think survival of the species at this point.",0,,,1,science
nuc5wy,0,Soil biome can only put up a fight if it isn't destroyed by the massive amounts of pesticides and herbicides that are sprayed over it.,0,,,4,science
nuc5wy,1,"There’s a balance that needs to be struck as well. With reduced pesticide and herbicide use, increasing in tillage is likely. Tillage is also quite detrimental for the soil biome and there’s not an easy way to fix industrialized farming as it currently stands.",0,,,5,science
nuc5wy,0,Feed the soil organics to feed the plants. Better crop rotation.,0,,,1,science
nuc5wy,1,"It's not only a better ceop rotation that is needed but the use of cover crops and better use of biodiversity in field. Laval University in Québec did a great analysis about how to maximize productivity and production with biodiversity and less pesticides(or none). The result was vastly more profitable to go full green and stop turning the soil between every crop.

nuc5wy,0,"I have been thinking of a green power generation/carbon capture system where you plant a fast growing crop such as some of the grasses, mow it when tall and then put the grass in a coker system where the grass is heated to drive off the volatile compounds but not to the point where the carbon itself burns. You are left with light gases that can be used for conventional gas-based energy and carbon that can be used as a soil conditioner.      
This would be a less than carbon neutral way of generating energy as much of the carbon would be actually captured and put into the soil.",0,,,0,science
nuc5wy,1,"Something like this is being developed by Porsche, called e-fuel. It doesn’t involve biomass, but instead uses wind power to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and to split hydrogen and oxygen apart in water by electrolysis. Electrolysis is also used to create methane, which is then refined to gasoline. It can be used as a direct replacement for existing gasoline engines and is essentially carbon neutral, assuming all the infrastructure for distribution uses renewables and e-fuel. While expensive,  carbon-neutral liquid fuels could be a bridge to complete electrification and may even be preferable considering the impacts of manufacturing and recycling batteries.",0,,,3,science
