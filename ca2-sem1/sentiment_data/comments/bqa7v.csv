bqa7v,2,"I don’t know theeminus’ experiment, I’ve never been to a science fair (I’m Australian) and I certainly know that no teacher or marker is perfect, but it’s unfair to just assume that the teacher is wrong.

Whether or not you prove your hypothesis has little to do with how you should be graded. Whether your hypothesis has a basis in theory is important, but if you prove a sensible hypothesis wrong, that’s great. In this case, unless you have a mechanism for why electrified plants grow better, the “correct” hypothesis is that they don’t, whether or not this turns out to be the case. If you do have a mechanism, and your experiment shows it – even better. But if you just baselessly take a positive position, that’s bad science. 

Inconclusive results are bad, but if you say your inconclusive results prove something, that’s even worse. It ceases to be science at that point. It also discredits most analysis of the experiment, meaning that it can almost singlehandedly cause someone to fail. I wouldn’t be surprised if threeminus’s experiment would have been better labelled inconclusive, because there wasn’t enough of an effect, or enough repetition, or because outside factors were not sufficiently controlled. Just because he’s right doesn’t mean he had a good project. And also, this experiment is about mushrooms. Grass is about as similar to a mushroom as it is to people, and I don’t think lightning helps people grow.

Unfortunately teachers do seem to relax these issues when they *know* the hypothesis is correct, so doing actually original research is somewhat of a risk. Of course rigorous and original research that adds to the scientific literature is the best thing you can do. So it’s a risk – one that is rewarding if you make sure you do it by the book.

The same is true to greater degrees in other fields – English essays are marked less harshly if they agree with the perceptions of the marker — until they’re good enough to change the markers mind, at which point they’re the best essay ever. History is easier if you view the topic from the perspective the teacher knows, unless you’re so thorough that you have them questioning their own view — same with law, geography, philosophy, art… Even *math* suffers slightly. In middle school, if you were to say that every parabola has roots, you’d be wrong unless you’re rigorous enough to state that you include unreal roots. If you work out a question in a way that differs from the *standard* and get it wrong, you’re unlikely to get marks for logic and carried errors.",0,,,1,science

bqa7v,1,"You can't generalize scientific results pertaining to one organism. Mushrooms and corn are light-years apart.

Now for economic viability, shitake mushrooms are quite expensive if I remember my grocery shopping correctly and electricity is pretty cheap, especially if they're only exposed to short-term bolts of electricity. So yes, electrically shocking the fungi would probably be a good idea.

This isn't a terribly useful finding, nor terribly scientific unless they control vs. fertilization with an equivalent amount of nitrogen (they didn't even test for that!).  An unusual finding would be discovering some non-nitrogen component that is crucial to mushroom growth.",0,,,13,science
bqa7v,1,"I think it's very important to point out that fungi (mushrooms) aren't plants. They don't need fertilizer like plants do - they release enzymes that break down organic material (usually detritus) into smaller molecules, which they absorb. The two fungi the experiment used, nameko (*Pholiota nameko*) and shiitake (Lentinula edodes) are both saprophytes. Nameko is grown from grain and shiitake is grown from logs or compressed wood shavings. They break down starches, celluloses, lignins, glycans, etc to get their nutrients.

An important thing to remember is that the mycelium (body) of the fungus can produce any number of fruiting bodies (mushrooms.) Think of it more like apples growing on an apple tree - many, many mushrooms can be produced from a single mycelium. They measured the number of fruiting bodies produced by the mycelium after treatment, not the actual mass of the mycelium itself. It's not an easy thing to do, and I don't blame them for not doing it, but it would have been useful in determining if the treatment caused the growth of more fungus, or if the fungus didn't grow more but rather produced more mushrooms.

I suspect that the article is correct in stating that it is probably some kind of ""defensive"" response. It's pretty well-known by shiitake farmers that you have to ""shock"" the fungus into producing mushrooms, either by [beating (PDF)](http://www.fungifun.org/mushworld/Shiitake-Mushroom-Cultivation/mushroom-growers-handbook-2-mushworld-com-chapter01-03_p.22.pdf) the inoculated log with a stick or [cold-shocking](http://www.ehow.com/how_4466184_grow-shiitake-mushrooms.html) it. These simulate trauma and frost, respectively - both things that would really cut into the mushroom's ability to get its spores out if it didn't put out fruiting bodies immediately.

Anyway, I think it's probably similar to that. Lightning is a pretty traumatic thing for a fungus, I'm sure (biologically, they're much more closely related to animals than any other kingdom...)

Actually acting as if <rumour> is true without actual proof is totally unreasonable.

Prior to this study it was anecdotal, or worse - ignorant countryside fairy tale bullshit. No mechanism was proposed. There was no indication that it would be more true than any other old legend passed down by bored farmers with no education about bias or falsification.",0,,,1,science

That's the real rash assumption, in my opinion.  

This has happened before, which is part of the reason I'm a little on edge here.

That's a logical fallacy.",0,,,1,science

Prior to this study it was mythology. Similarly, Troy was a mere legend until someone took a shovel to Greece and dug it up.

The null hypothesis is central to the definition of science. Until something has been demonstrated, its probable truth value is a matter of ""common sense,"" i.e. guesswork based on past experience. Lighting strikes encouraging mushroom growth sounds like bullshit. Turns out it's not. The result was a complete surprise and you're berating people as though they denied a predicted outcome with a well-understood reason for occurring. ",0,,,1,science
bqa7v,4,"No, prior to this study it was working.  This is where my major gripe is.  I'm not saying you're not smart, it's nothing like that.   However, your verification of this phenomena does NOT change the real world effects that were taking place prior to your birth.  This is an observers error - you are placing too much importance on your own existance.  It was working before your were ever born.  

>Prior to this study it was mythology.

Also, Troy is in Ionia...close to Greece, but not technically Greece.  Provincial Greece, perhaps?

See for me, Anecdotal evidence is enough to pique my interest and to make me want a formal study.  Some people act like without a formal study, something is instantly bullshit.  This proves that that isn't true.

When proper scientific trials show that something works, it is accepted as working. There are a number of drugs whose operation we don't really understand, but we know that they _do_ work; trials show it.

When things fail proper trials, though, there's no reason to think that they work. Before someone tested it, this would have looked like homeopathy (also frequently tested). That it is shown to work when tested, unlike homeopathy, makes it different.",0,,,1,science
