52k6w9,0,"Wheat is a c3 grass.  C3 plants excel in cooler, wetter, and less bright areas...like I imagine the UK is all the time.  If you look strictly at temperature C3 plants are not going to excel.

Corn is a a C4 grass.  C4 plants excel in hotter, drier, brighter areas....like the midwest.  If you look strictly at temperature a hotter planet will favor C4.

If you look at a hotter, more humid, more CO2 planet then it gets less clear which will do better because ironically, those are near the perfect conditions for most plants.  Which I think the author addresses.

On the other hand, from the study:

> Adaptation to global warming, for example, farmer’s autonomous adaptation through changing sowing dates or cultivars, has been suggested in several studies to compensate negative impacts of increasing temperature 46. At the global scale, point-based simulations did not consider adaptation.

Well thats a fairly large caveat.  So if temperatures rise, and if we dont look at any other variable, and if farmers do absolutely nothing to change the way they farm in the face of a changing world, then wheat yields may decline as much as 6%.  If anything this result only shows how little we need to worry about temperature change and yield.  Even the most yield-retarded of farmers may not even notice.",0,,,2,science

",0,,,1,science
52k6w9,0,"That is very unconvincing. Wheat has an enormous range and different varieties have utterly different temperature optima. What most effects yield is water supply, so stored water wheat (Canada, S Australia) have much lower yields than rain fed wheat (Europe.) Now if climate models can offer convincing rainfall and snow delivery, that might offer something predictive. However, most in  fact predict increased rainfall, and so better and not worse wheat production. This is a good example of how ""climate science"" (a) does not engage with other disciplines and (b) tends to pick the data that reinforces its prior conclusions. ",0,,,2,science

52k6w9,1,"> We can actually see what has happened with a temperature rise of almost 1 degree C. Hint: it's massive growth, not a decrease.

Not my expertise, but a video I saw recently explained why your approach are misleading.

Plants do seem to have something like an [optimal temperature for growth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zprxsbk/revision) during the relevant months of the year. It was something like 26°C or 27°C, IIRC.

The problem is that the plant's reaction to deviations from that optimal temperature are asymmetric: 1°C below optimal temperature and you get a low decrease in yield. Say 95% of the maximum. With 1°C *above* optimal temperature, however, you get slightly larger decreases in yield, say 90% of the maximum. (The numbers are merely for illustration of the asymmetry.)

And the asymmetry gets stronger, the higher the deviation from the optimal temperature.

Many food crops are grown in latitudes with temperatures slightly below the optimal temperature: The American corn fields, Europe, Ukraine, China, etc. Therefore, a small increase in temperature that starts from below optimum can increase yields.

For countries closer to the equator, however, temperatures are already at or above optimal temperature. An increase there will lead to large losses in yield. And in the long term, even temperatures in America, Europe, etc. can increase above the optimum.

Hope this helps.",0,,,1,science
52k6w9,2,"Lets accept that as true, and even increase the potential downside for high temp to 10% for ease of use.

Let's also assume that 2014 was the perfect temperature for optimal wheat growth.  So 1961-2014 we were gaining for the increase from too cold to just right, and 2014 onward we are losing from getting too hot.

If the effect is asymmetrically larger on the hot side, then we can say that the cold side in 1961 was suppressing yields by at most the same amount (and likely less). Thus increase in temperature over 1961-2014 was responsible for at most 10% of our 375% gain.

Other climate and non-climate factors must be responsible for the other 365%.

Hold those other factors constant, and apply a 10% reduction for temps and we would still have overall growth of 355%.

Do we know those other factors will stay constant?  Absolutely not, but it also seems unlikely that that they will completely disappear.

So be optimistic: absolute cereal production is extremely unlikely to drop, in fact it is almost certain to continue growing (though the rate of growth may slow a little).

[Edit: fixed start dates to 1961 to match my first comment.",0,,,1,science
52k6w9,3,"> Other climate and non-climate factors must be responsible for the other 365%.

Sure, other factors are relevant as well.

However, it was my impression that the point of your initial comment was to show that temperatur increase in the future is no reason to worry, because food production increased despite temperatur increase in the past.",0,,,1,science
