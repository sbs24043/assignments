twjdmc,0,A  sad thing is that many of their farming practices are harmful to both bees and birds.,0,,,134,science
twjdmc,1,Humans as well sometimes,0,,,44,science
twjdmc,1,Poor farming practices which don't understand the land properly classic human ignorance really,0,,,13,science

twjdmc,0,The [Smithsonian Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/migratory-birds/bird-friendly) has a bird friendly certification for coffee and the standards are marvelous. It’s definitely worth buying if you care about this kind of thing.,0,,,73,science
twjdmc,1,"Ok this is awesome, I searched my zip code and there was one choice near me, which was the allegro coffee I bought at Whole Foods yesterday!",0,,,4,science
twjdmc,2,"This is the one I usually buy because it's the only one available around here. The one they have is is a morning blend, but you do have to look for the bird friendly certification. I like it, it's a pretty decent blend.",0,,,2,science
twjdmc,1,"That's actually really cool, will pick some up. Appreciate that info, had never seen it before.",0,,,3,science
twjdmc,2,"It can be hard to find, I will warn you. I know Whole Foods carries Allegro coffee and they have a breakfast blend that is certified bird friendly. If you happen to live where there is a Natural Grocers, they also have a bird friendly coffee called Birds and Beans. The biggest problem with bird friendly coffee is that it can acutally be realy hard to find. It's a very small corner of the market so stores don't stock it, people don't know it exists, no one buys it, so grocers don't carry it, then no one buys it because it's hard to find, and on and on and on. It's a viscious cycle. So if you don't have anyone who stocks it, ask them to. Most people just don't know it exists.",0,,,3,science
twjdmc,3,"Yeah, I honestly had no idea it was a thing. I buy from a couple of local roasters and I'll definitely mention it. I do some online buying as I'm super rural but will also suggest it to the roasters I use.",0,,,2,science
twjdmc,1,Thanks for this info,0,,,1,science
twjdmc,0,"It's sad that the only way to make authorities act on preserving biodiversity is by presenting the economic costs that the destruction of our environment entail. Life itself has no value for the systems that we have created and come to worship, only the costs matter.",0,,,19,science
twjdmc,0,This is the right way to present climate change to capitalists. More of this.,0,,,16,science
twjdmc,0,"A great thing to look for on your bag of coffee to help with protecting not only our coffee, but also the biodiversity coffee plants provide...
Look for ""shade-grown"" on your bag of beans. Shade grown coffee is the ""natural"" way coffee grows and provides shelter for migratory birds. Although, it doesn't provide as large of a yield, it does tend to provide high quality coffee while also providing great benefits to our environment.",0,,,4,science
twjdmc,0,Is this what they mean by the birds and the bees?,0,,,6,science
twjdmc,1,And the flowers and the trees.,0,,,1,science

twjdmc,0,"So 100% of a coffee crop yield would be $4,264 per hectare? Divide 26 billion (total coffee market) by $4,264 you get  6,097,560 hectares of Earth devoted to the coffee industry. That's 8.5 times the size of Hawaii. I can't imagine anyone today thinking that it would be a good idea to buy hectares of land, and start planting coffee plants with the hope that if you work hard for years, and you get lucky and don't have any crop failures, that one day they might rake in $4,200 per hectare worked. What this study shows me is that coffee prices are going to keep going up.",0,,,2,science
twjdmc,1,"I was thinking the same. Just checking briefly I see massive disparities in numbers on actual lbs per acre. From 3000 lbs to 10,000. Not mention that's acre not hectare so I'm going go go out on a limb and say this 1000 dollar loss could be off quite significantly as is the thought on average yield per hectare. 


Again though tbf, in large parts of the world making 4000 per hectare would be a great living.",0,,,1,science
