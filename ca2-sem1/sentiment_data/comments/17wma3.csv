17wma3,0,"A) CO2 is -never- the limiting nutrient. Plants growth is not retarded due to lack of CO2. Micro-nutrients, in particular Nitrogen, are what generally determine plant growth. A model-based projection like this does not take real-world growth constraints into account and therefore presents a very skewed result. 

B) [The referee comments](http://www.biogeosciences-discuss.net/9/C3793/2012/bgd-9-C3793-2012-print.pdf) for this paper suggest it shouldn't have been published because it does not take into account non-carbon fluxes and land-use changes, which can have huge impacts.  It also confines and conflates potential variables into one observational constraint(reducing complex sinks and fluxes to a single estimate). Further, it equates grassland to pasture or crop land, which are two **very** different beasts. 

C) The study admits that it is not meant to apply to the real world, but is more important as a calibration of climate models dealing with nitrogen limits. From the study (emphasis mine): ""Although a negligible fertilisation effect appears difficult to reconcile with this analysis, **it is important to reiterate that some of the possible mechanisms that are likely to contribute to the terrestrial sink are not modelled.** These processes are therefore subsumed into our calibration of CO2 fertilisation. This estimate should, however, be useful for other Earth sys- tem models as they, in general, will neglect similar sinks. **It is also very important to reiterate that the subsumed processes represent a source of structural error and that caution is re- quired when extrapolating these results into the future.**

...
Although the uncertainty is substantial, the result is useful for two reasons. **Firstly, the analysis is by definition a cali- bration of the fertilisation effect net of other limiting factors, most notably nitrogen limitation (and its alleviation through nitrogen deposition).** The calibration simply provides a dy- namical description of the globally averaged vegetation re- sponse that reproduces the observed historical change in at- mospheric CO2. Secondly, the approach does not impose a direct prior constraint on the strength of CO2 fertilisation. As such, it provides a useful independent constraint that can be used in conjunction with existing estimates from CO2 enrichment experiments.""

D) Given the quote from the study bolded above, ""It is also very important to reiterate that...caution is required when extrapolating these results into the future."" I would suggest that this title is then an editorialization, and therefore not fit for r/science. ""will allow"" is precisely what is meant by ""extrapolating these results into the future.""

17wma3,4,"> Actually we're at approximately .6C since the warm period peak at the end of the 1800s and .4C since the warm period of the early 40s.

That is a gross and intentional misrepresentation of the scale of AGW - and one that is often seen from AGW deniers - among other things since the anthropogenic CO2 rise dates long before the years that you cherry-picked, and even more relevant since ocean temperatures have very little relevance to a post about land crops.

[Here](http://berkeleyearth.org/results-summary/) is a recent page with data about land temperatures and I must insist on [this PDF graph from the same source which depicts temperatures and CO2+volcanic forcing](http://berkeleyearth.org/pdf/decadal-with-forcing.pdf) - when you look at the real data that is relevant to actual crops the truth looks a lot different, doesn't it?

17wma3,1,"How obvious is it really, I assume that for most plants CO2 is not the limiting factor. If you turn up the concentration of a factor that is not limiting, ther is no effect. More water in a rainforest for example wont doo you much good. If you look at the experimental evidence they cite you will see that the measured effects were well below 40-60% in natural condition. If you look at greenhouses where all the conditions are optimal however, increasing CO2 does have a much bigger effect.",0,,,9,science
17wma3,2,"Plants need three things to grow: sunlight, water, and CO2.  Water is probably the limiting factor, but that is not the only issue. Turning up the concentration of ANY factor will shift the equilibrium.  Limiting factors come into play where they actually run out - in this case, some areas may have excess water, where some do not.  But plant growth is never going to DECREASE due to excess CO2, whereas in many areas it will certainly increase.  Hence why double CO2 does not lead to double plant growth, but still a significant increase nonetheless.",0,,,1,science
