http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig's_law_of_the_minimum

Which says that the lowest available nutrient is always the limiting factor unless you're at saturation point, where the plant can no longer absorb any more than it's given.

This article lists all the known nutrient vectors for plants which could cause limitations

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_nutrition

This list may not be complete though yet, some of those, for instance silicon, are relatively new additions to the list. They used to think silica was completely inert and didn't add any value to the plant, but it's addition to hydroponic tomatoes was shown to cause a massive increase in hydroponic yield. 
(I think it was a 200% gain but the article is now a dead-link in my bookmarks)

In farm fields typically only N-P-K (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium) is sprayed on the field to aid in nutrition, as they are the main nutrients. The rest of the secondary macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients are left for the plants to pull right out of the existing soil. Eventually that itself has led to nutrient depletion, so more and more farms are conditioning their soil with more than just N-P-K to keep the yield up.

This behavior of depletion is also one of the sticky points with mono-culture industrial farming. As it has been shown to deplete the nutrients in the Microbiota and lead to a sterile environment in the soil.

Risks are already moderate because of regionally differentiated climate-change impacts on crop production in particular (medium to high confidence). Based on projected decreases in regional crop yields and water availability, risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high for additional warming above 2°C (medium confidence).

>[Page 17-18] For the major crops (wheat, rice, and maize) in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late-20th-century levels, although individual locations may benefit (medium confidence). Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the period 2030-2049 showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, compared to the late 20th century. After 2050 the risk of more severe yield impacts increases and depends on the level of warming. See Figure SPM.7. Climate change is projected to progressively increase inter-annual variability of crop yields in many regions. These projected impacts will occur in the context of rapidly rising crop demand.

To add further, faster growth does not mean a faster lifecycle. It only means that more growth would happen during the same lifecycle. The speed of a lifecycles is controlled more by the seasonality of an area, which is much more dependent on the distance of a plant from the equator than the composition of the air around it.

For example, many companies looking to grow up seed faster go to equatorial countries in South America because you can fully grow a corn field in ~90 days while the typical time from planting to harvest for corn in the U.S. is about double that.",0,,,3,science

Nope. The only way you're turning over crops more quickly is if you start from mature cuttings or the plant is genetically programmed for short seasons. There is still the factor of ripening time, proper conditions for triggering reproductive structures to form, etc.",0,,,2,science
251c4o,9,"You could, but what would more likely happen would be that cultivars that can take advantage of longer growing seasons would be grown. So instead of planting 2 crops, we would still plant just 1 because it would have longer to grow even bigger. 

I don't actually know which one would result in the most food at the end of the season, but I know growing that extra crop can be economically unfeasible for a farmer. That means you are doing twice the amount of work planting and harvesting per season, and all that fuel and labor isn't cheap. We need those guys to stay in business to keep growing food. 

Currently in the Illinois, some people double crop winter wheat and soybeans, but those farmers are in the minority. It reduces the growing season of the soybean (which makes more money that wheat), and it can be too much to do for some people running a smaller operation. ",0,,,2,science

Crops like maize and sorghum on the other hand, would not benefit from heightened CO2 at all because they do C4 photosynthesis that already concentrates the CO2 before it reaches RUBISCO, the plant enzyme that initially grabs CO2 out of the air. So once again, the more extreme climate conditions due to global warming will also have an effect on C4 crops, and they don't even have the extra photosynthetic boost like the C3 crops will be getting",0,,,4,science

In some crops there is an optimum level and going beyond that reduces yields by increasing production of leaf instead of the fruit or vegetable that is wanted.  More is not always better.

Genneraly the concentration of CO2 is not the limiting factor in plant growth anyway so more is not necessarily better in any but some greenhouse situations where all the relevant conditions can be controlled to maximize growth.
