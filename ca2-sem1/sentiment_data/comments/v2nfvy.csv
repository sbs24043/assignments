v2nfvy,0,"Itâ€™s interesting when you think that, at least in the US, the agriculture-dependent communities would stand to gain the most by reducing air pollution.  Yet these communities largely oppose efforts or to rely less on the contributors to air pollution like fossil fuels, and more on renewables like solar and wind power.",0,,,7,science

v2nfvy,1,"They find a much bigger effect than I'd expected:  
> ""Using simple counterfactuals and leveraging published relationships between greenness and growth, we estimate that reducing NOx levels to the current fifth percentile in each region would raise yields by ~25% for winter crops in China, ~15% for summer crops in China, and up to 10% in other regions.""

China accounts for [20% of world cereal production](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.PRD.CREL.MT), so based on their findings achieving this NOx pollution reduction would result in **12% improvement in crop yields**.

(For reference, the World Bank link indicates that's 5-10 years of crop yield improvement at normal rates.)",0,,,5,science

Literally read the study to see what I mean, because its clear you haven't",0,,,15,science
