Statements like that are categorically false as GMOs are not a single thing. *Some of the current GMOs* have the properties you mentioned, but genetic modification is a tool, not a class of crop.

5igqkg,1,"**Abstract:**


The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population
growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed
in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential
and resilience1,2
. Genetic modification is one potential solution,
but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops
such as wheat3
. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal
in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning
crop growth and development4,5
. Here we show that application
of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels
in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed
and constructed based on a ‘signalling-precursor’ concept for
permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P
in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar
signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue
improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology
offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress
resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and
other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that
suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can
be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other
organism function.",0,,,2,science

I find this a little odd. Wheat has an interesting mechanism by which the developing sink in the grain starves the roots of sugars; these stop producing cytokines and the entire plant then goes into senescence, breaking down its starch, hemicellulose and proteins to feed the greed, grasping grain. Modern wheat can remobilise 75% of its dry weight, putting 65% of its entire dry mass into theh seed before snuffing it. (This process is why, if you look at a dry wheat field, you'll see a few green plants scattered around the base of the crop. All of them have lost their grain ear, and so haven't slipped into senescence.

The question is why T6P would alter this process. One mechanisms may be to delay maturity. In areas where water is not limiting - as it is in much of the world, but say South Australia as typical - pushing back the maturation starting gun by a few weeks would allow photosynthesis to occur for longer, reserves to be that much larger. ",0,,,5,science

The claim of 20% yield increases is worthless without a field trial. You simply cannot measure yield in a greenhouse. ",0,,,7,science

5igqkg,0,"This is every interesting. Read an article here about algal starch creation was about 20% more efficient than land plants, esp. human domesticated crops.

So the green revolution might make it possible to grow larger grains by some 40% or more if these two methods work and are used jointly.

Sadly, the head of grain will pull down the stalks and so the grain might well be lost. What's necessary in addition, it to make more robust stalks and heads to bear the larger grains. PLUS the chaff which surrounds the bare grains will be larger and heavier, necessarily.

So it's complex system. Increase the weight of the car, and we need heavier, more weight bearing suspensions and frames. Increased grain size works the same demand upon the wheat stalks and so forth. Roots will have to grow larger, as well.

Somewhere there's bound to be wild and other varieties of wheat with more robust stalks and heads than those commonly used......

& then with heavy rain, or wind, too, the larger heads will be far more likely to break or collapse the stalks. So it's a whole complex system of changes which will need to be made on wheat plants, if this finding can be duplicated by others and is the case.

And because it increases the efficiencies of grain production by 10-20%, if true, it will spread very quickly through all agro markets & systems which can grow such wheat.

then the increased nutrients the wheat will need to grow more grain; iron, Mg++, phosphorus, K+, Ca++ and so forth will need to be added. One of the biggest new demands made when the golden rice was created, with larger grains and more productivity, that artificial fertilizers had to be added or the rice could not grow enough to be able to make best use of the potential there. Suspect this will also be true of larger wheat grain size varieties. It's NOT simple, either.

Also missing are the very real genetic effects of efficiencies. Most wild plants are VERY efficient in growing seeds. But when we domesticate plants (oranges, navels) and dogs, for example, we find a VERY great number of new mutations, compared to wild varieties. Changing the genome, even by selective genetics, destabilizes and makes it less efficient.

Thus we have destabilized the genomes of our domesticated plants and animals, and they are NOT as genetically efficient as they could be. There could be a WHOLE can of worms released by making a few changes in our domesticated varieties, which could be loss of resistance to diseases, variable growth problems,and many other, incomprehensible outcomes of making such, apparently, simple, genetic changes.  

It's NOT that simple, therefore, adding a new crop spray, because it's complex system, NOT linear processes ongoing.

Kinda hard to do since there's no genetically engineered wheat commercially available.  There were a few glyphosate tolerant strains developed, but they arrived just as the major backlash against GMO's occurred so they were never sold.

>One other thing to keep in mind, Glyphosate, the active ingredient in round up, was created to increase yields. It was found that it did a great job killing plants at higher rates. So they marketed that. 

Glyphosate was developed as a chelating agent, it would never even in small doses boost plant yields since it works by binding to and disabling a protein necessary to produce amino acids.  ",0,,,8,science
