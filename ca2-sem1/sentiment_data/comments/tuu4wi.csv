tuu4wi,1,"Man don’t be a cunt. If they’re on farm roads or kids are in the street of a dead end road who cares. Shoot fireworks enjoy life. Just be reasonable and I can be neighborly. If you don’t like it, you should’ve bought their “5acres” before they did. That’ll teach em.",0,,,-121,farming

I've had assholes shoot their fireworks over my pasture and animals because their shitty little yards weren't enough space to see them right. Had my dairy cow so stressed out she wouldn't stop running all night and I couldn't get her into the barn for anything. 

Same neighbors sent their shitty fucking kids to play in my yard, they knocked over stacked hay, killed a chicken laying behind the stack and used the hay to get to the places baby birds were and killed them. I raised a few I found because the parents weren't coming back after that. They chased a newborn foal through the fence and skinned its leg.",0,,,21,farming

tuu4wi,0,"Even I feel bad scouting with my ATV and I'm allowed to be on it. I try to avoid scouting near the villages in te area because the little kids . ""monkey see monkey do"" we even put up fences to keep them off.",0,,,13,farming
tuu4wi,0,This infuriates me! We ride ATVs but only on our own ATV trails or at ATV parks only! To have zero regard for someones food & income is despicable!,0,,,5,farming
tuu4wi,0,"Bad camera angle to see if he's actually driving the edge or in the actual field driving over fresh seed. Most fields have 2 tracks that run the perimeter. In addition, maybe it's the guy in the UTVs field? 

We lease fields on rotations and just because we lease certain ground doesn't mean we can't drive the edges for weed control or predater control or do whatever we feel like doing to maintain the ground.",0,,,8,farming
tuu4wi,0,Not sure I understand. Are they trespassing and that’s why you’re upset? Or do you think driving across seed in the ground is a bad thing?,0,,,6,farming
tuu4wi,1,This could actually be the farmer. Farmers do it all the time to scout for issues. You can drive all over most broad acre crops without damaging anything whatsoever as long as it’s early,0,,,11,farming
tuu4wi,2,"Yep I drive across upwards of 40,000 acres a year of cropland with no problem. That’s why I was asking why he was so upset over it.",0,,,8,farming
tuu4wi,0,"We’ve found that it gets a lot worse if you try scaring them off by yelling or calling the cops. Regardless, it’ll likely continue no matter which method you use. But they seem to be more respectful if you tolerate it. Put some signs up so they can’t sue if they get hurt at least. Plus the majority will respect the sign. It’s usually kids… so if you get them stopped… there’s going to be another batch of kids the next year who are now old enough to ride. For me, it’s not worth the stress or high blood pressure to constantly police it.",0,,,2,farming
tuu4wi,0,"That looks like a great way to get near lead poisoning. 


I say “near” because anyone who shoots at a person with intent to kill for driving over plants is evil.",0,,,-2,farming
