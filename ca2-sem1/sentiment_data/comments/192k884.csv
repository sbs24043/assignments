I have noticed on hte map when placing things in buildings it often pours through the walls, unfortunately. 

I got the potato/beet cellar mod and placed it down by the pond. It's a really cool storage mod, highly recommend checking it out. It has a placeable shute and belt system for loading. And interior and exterior lights. [Picture of it on the map here.](https://imgur.com/a/Udhr3aB)",0,,,3,farmingsimulator
