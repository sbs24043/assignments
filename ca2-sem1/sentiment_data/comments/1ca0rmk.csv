But with regards to phosphate I find it very hard to imagine that in the next century there we be absolutely no technological advances and increases in efficiency allowing use both to reduce our reliance on both phosphate and other resources and also more efficient prospecting and extraction of new deposits. I would be very surprised if this does not buy us enough time to reach the level of technological advancement we are able to properly implement some kind of circular economy. Of course it would be possible t use our resources much more efficiently with current technology, and it would be nice if that was the case, but to for example ration resources like phosphate with a time horizon of it lasting for a thousand years would have catastrophical consequences for the current population, and as I wrote earlier I think we will get on fine and in fact much better if we don't.",0,,,4,science

1ca0rmk,0,"Research ""Regenerative Agriculture"" and you'll eventually learn that many nutrients can be unlocked from soil or collected from the air by biology rather than carting around chemical fertilizers:

Potassium: Winter rye, Dutch Clover

Phosphorous: Buckwheat

Nitrogen: Dutch Clover, Black Lentils, Alfalfa

Chemical fertilizers are ""convenience products"" like buying frozen TV dinners or ordering pizza delivery instead of cooking up dinner from scratch. You need to plan ahead, like winter rye must be planted the prior fall, or know that last year's herbicides in the ground can kill your new alternative plantings for two more years (but you still have bills to pay). Different equipment is needed (more investment) with different techniques (that are less understood). 

Hardest change: ""teaching old farm dogs new tricks""; but understand it's like taking a job you've been doing successfully for thirty years and going in on any given Monday to do something wildly different that if you fail you'll lose your job, farm, and maybe even the family. Many are obligated by bank operating loans by selling next fall's harvest grain in the spring to buy inputs like seed, fuel, and chemicals to grow that harvest; plus making machinery payments on time. The banks want a sure thing or they take your farm. 

Some farmers are testing, some are half converted, some have been doing this for a decade. It's an industry transition with a tightly knit web that needs to be spun into a different process with material risks to all stake holders. Many Regen Ag principles were used back in the 1920s/30s and it took a few generations of farmers for big industry to train them to use the current convenience products.

Too abrupt of a transition = food shortages = civil unrest and revolution. 

The bigger challenge: there are more acres of suburban lawn under cultivation in the US than acres of food farms with homeowners who have a lawn hobby or hire landscaping companies to 'farm' their property so it looks like a golf course. A lot of fertilizer and water goes out there, and then in the rivers and things. But there is big business in landscaping, so that will be a huge challenge if cutting off their chemicals to ensure a longer supply and transition period for farming.
