18vvokh,1,"Well, if past weather holds true: you've got the last week of February as a goal line! :)

It's crazy mild, we're too late into the season for any major freeze-up of the lake; the winter storms are gonna wreak havoc on the shoreline here.",0,,,6,farming
18vvokh,2,I might just run the drill through the fields to get the neighbors talking. There isn't enough drama in the neighborhood and I should really contribute once and awhile.,0,,,7,farming
18vvokh,3,"Hahah... We'll likely hear about it all the way down here if you start seeding oats in February. I have a neighbour who has had great luck seeding his that first week of March though, going into frozen sands.

The drama down here is two BTOs offering 100-150$/ac more rent vs the normal average area rate. A lot of angry operators right now.",0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,4,"One neighbor just dropped 1.8m on a 100 acre farm. The other neighbor has a 100 acre for sale and got upset when all the offers were 700k, there looking for 1.4m but it needs 200k in tile and another 100k in landscaping.

They can offer that but can they sustain that? A couple people tried that in the Bruce and they no longer farm.",0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,5,"Here in the balmy south (Missouri) this year a guy paid $34,800 an acre for 115 acres in our counties ""golden triangle.""  We have a patch of soil in the Salt Springs bottoms that are outside the Missouri River flood plain that is as good of dirt as anywhere on the planet.  It's about 8 miles north of my farm, which is real good dirt as well, more hills than the bottoms though.

But Jesus Christ, $4 million for 115 acres.  Sure it'll yield nearly 300 bushel corn, but daaaammmnnnnnn..... those payments.

The ripple effect has hit my operation as my wife found about this and now thinks we own a gold mine.",0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,4,"Are the BTO’s making money at that price for rent?  Or are they just wearing out equipment faster.

We had one local dairy farm start doing that this year, they paid $325-$400 rent for land that should have been $200-$225.  There’s another BTO that bought ~150 acres that was put up for auction bc no one was buying and the farmer needed the $, but they farm for a hobby as they’re land speculators and based around Ottawa but own land everywhere.

My uncle also lost ~50 acres that he’s been renting, it’s the one he’s been clearing stones from (why he got the Elho) and even tiled it this year.  We told him to buy it when the orchard it’s owned by was sold, he’ll regret that now as he lost $ and time.

Thanks for the threads, I’ve been slacking.",0,,,3,farming
18vvokh,5,Schoutens? They have 1300 acres for sale in the southern end of the county here. Land has definitely cooled a bit here. Couple of pieces are sitting with no bites,0,,,3,farming
18vvokh,6,"Yep, do you have the listing?  There hasnt been much coming up around me since late fall and even then it wasnt that much other then ine farm being over 500 acres.  

Houses are really starting to sit on the market, so I think the real estate boom is slowing.",0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,7,"https://culliganrealestate.ca/properties/large-cash-crop-opportunity-in-ottawa-valley-1300-acres-tillable-for-sale/
There’s a couple of new builds here that haven’t sold yet and houses are not going crazy over asking anymore either. I think the crazy is off now it’s the aftermath we deal with",0,,,3,farming
18vvokh,8,"I hate these no price listings, even for equipment it drives me nuts.  If you’re selling you have a price in mind, have the balls to say it.  Have you heard the asking?",0,,,3,farming
18vvokh,9,Amen! There’s nothing worse than opening the Agdealer and seeing please contact for price. I heard it’s 10.5 million. It’s pretty spread out basically in two groups one close to Renfrew and one closer Arnprior. I think they’d have an easier time selling if they broke it up. What happened with the 500 acres? Someone local get it?,0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,7,"> Houses are really starting to sit on the market, so I think the real estate boom is slowing.

I've noticed this, now sellers can start to notice and lower their asking prices.",0,,,4,farming
18vvokh,8,"We’ll see how long they hold out, I’ve seen a few stubborn ones listed for months without lowering the price.  I just can’t see how this spring isn’t a huge drop, even with new builds.",0,,,6,farming
