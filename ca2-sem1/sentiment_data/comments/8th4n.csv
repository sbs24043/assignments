Arguably the benefit to yield comes by chemically killing all competing plants in the field with increasingly larger doses (purchases) of chemicals. 

GM has possibilities and should not be totally written off based on a company that implemented the technology poorly. Maybe if a seed GM'r who modified the genetics to grow more seeds per plant, larger seeds per plant (this one would really screw with the AG equipment), or both, then, maybe yields would have a better chance of actually increasing.

That's true, but the end result is similar.  The crops are roundup resistant, so the yields will be higher than normal, simply because the plant doesn't spend energy fighting off bugs or competing with weeds for food.  It should be noted that, based on the one study I read (on tomatoes), that this also yields far less nutritious food, because the plant develops its nutrient mix precisely to fight off damaging organisms.    End result is a plant that tends to be larger and faster growing, yielding more food, but with less actual nutrients in the final product.

The truth is, the free market doesn't work where market forces are unbalanced - which is pretty much everywhere, and definitely is the case in agrobusiness. 

Monsanto and their ilk are buying up seed providers all around the world, so they can push their GMO seeds forward for lack of an alternative. They are suing farmers who haven't bought their product as soon as there is contamination (which is often, and might in some cases be malicious). They have multi-million dollars marketing campaigns and lobbying going on to push pro-GMOs legislations (subventions and deregulations). They oppose labelling food products so they can be immune from consumer backlash.

How exactly is a free market going to stop all that?

Of course, GMO tech _depends_ on traditional breeding methods to work.  GMO tech has never _competed_ with traditional breeding, it has always been an additive compliment to it.  The comparison this study is making is false.  It makes me wonder if they made additional false comparisons.  For instance the article also states: 

""Meanwhile, the report found that Bt corn likely provides a marginal operational yield advantage of 3 to 4 percent over typical conventional practices. Since Bt corn became commercially available in 1996, its yield advantage averages out to a 0.2 to 0.3 percent yield increase per year. To put that figure in context, overall U.S. corn yields over the last several decades have annually averaged an increase of approximately one percent, which is considerably more than what Bt traits have provided. ""

Of course, BT corn hasn't been around for decades, and in the first few years of its life, it simply wasn't as good at what it does as it is now, skewing the average downward.  So if recent averages of 3-4% can be maintained or improved in future years, that 0.3% lifetime average will only get larger and larger.  I expect similar trends can be expected for other GMO crops, which may have specific advantages in really weedy areas, but which have yet to be more broadly applicable, and thus keeping global yield averages flat or lower than the oxymoronic sounding ""conventional innovations"".",0,,,1,science

8th4n,4,">(although the gene-cannon method of splicing genes seems very unstable, and from what I understand it is the main form of splicing for plants).

What seems ""unstable"" about it and how are you defining ""unstable""?  Stability of a gene in its host has nothing to do with the method of its introduction, so I'm not clear what you mean exactly.  Most methods of gene introduction are fairly violent on a cellular level, but relative to the assaults organisms face in being simply outdoors, the gene gun is insignificant.

>But my problem is the heavy-handed business pratices that go along GM crops, which can and already have had very deleterious effects (bankrupcies, suicides, loss of necessary diversity in seeds, mutant maize in Mexico, lack of unbiased health-risk assessments, etc.)

Let me dissect these each one by one:

Bankruptcies - yes, although I'm unaware of any bankruptcies caused by the GM bizthat were not part of usual business competition.

Suicides? Please inform me, I don't know of any stories about people committing suicide over a GM-related biz practice.  And even if there were, can the GM-relationship to the business practice really be blamed, or is it something that could have happened in response to a similar business practice from any other industry?

Loss of necessary diversity of seeds.  Not exactly.  Most people don't recognize that GM tech is totally dependent upon and born of traditional crop breeding an monoculture.  The loss of diversity is a consequence of traditional agricultural practices, and GM's contribution to this phenomenon only goes so far as GM is connected to traditional agriculture.

mutant maize in Mexico: If you read about those stores very carefully, you'll find that neither side of the issue can prove that either the seeds weren't simply stolen and/or were stolen and bred with regular ""maize"" or that the ""maize was really contaminated by cross-pollenation.  Scientifically speaking, the likelihood that cross-pollination occurred is very very low, and theft is the far more likely mechanism.  Unfortunately, there is enough reasonable doubt among any scientist who might be called to testify about the impossibility of cross pollination that Monsanto can never outright win these legal battles.

Lack of unbiased health assessments - as other have pointed out, GM crops are the most scrutinized crops in all of human history.  Putting aside accusations of bias for the moment, one needs to recognize that ""traditional crops"" that we eat to day are several orders of magnitude different genetically from what humans ate just 200 years ago, and that the degree of difference between a GMO plant and its non-GMO parent is infinitesimal.  So with that said, why aren't people clamoring in the streets for more scrutiny and safety testing of cross-bred, selected, and hybrid-derived, ""traditional""  crop foods?

As far as your last paragraph is concerned I largely agree with you, but don't forget that patents expire after 20 years, and that patented methods of growing crops still have to compete in the market with non-patented methods.  So if no real advantage in cost or yield is realized from a patented process, no one will buy it and it will be worthless.  It isn't like the patent holders can deprive you of low-priced food, all they can do is prevent you from buying those seeds with the better margin/yield ratio from another company or individual.

In my mind Monsanto's biggest problem is that none of their lawyers understand the technology, and none of their marketing people understand the public or the technology.  Any company with this kind of incompetence is going to look stupid at best or evil at worst.  The only thing Monsanto really has going for it is the quality of their science which, with the incompetence of other departments, stands undefended.  Their R&D is the only thing keeping that company alive at the moment.",0,,,1,science
8th4n,5,"For a lot of what you're asking, I'll just direct you to the documentary I've linked to earlier, which clarifies much of what I've been trying to say here. It's 110 mn long, and I can't go on forever.

As for the ""unstable"" thing, what I meant to say is that no one seems to know exactly what side-effect these techniques could have, since it's basically the introduction of a gene by brute force into a cell nucleus. Does it destroy other genes? Does it overwrite them, does it combine with them in new way, leading to new proteins being formed? One story in **The World According To Monsanto** shows how a cotton plant modified by this technique lost its defense against a common fungus, destroying entire recolts and bringing hundred of little farms to ruin in India. Of course, such a fiasco has many dependencies (difficulty to access credit, world rates for cotton, poverty in emergent countries) but it shows that GM crops have unforeseen side-effects, and while cotton is a ""benign"" example, the precaution principle would have us being very careful about introducing these technologies in the environment.

> [...] as other have pointed out, GM crops are the most scrutinized crops [...]

An oft-repeated lie, but a lie nonetheless. I do not blame you, I saw that same argument developped in countless TV news shows, documentaries and editorial pieces over the years. Then I heard about the [Substantial Equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_equivalence) concept. It is now used by the FDA, the WHO and the OECD (among others) to regulate how GMOs are ""scrutinized"" before being put on the market. To quote :

*Vandana Shiva concluded: ""a very convenient tool called substantial equivalence principle was cooked up to say 'let's just treat genetically engineered organisms like conventional crops'. Of course, they don't say that, when they want to patent these things. At that point, they say these are absolutely ""novel"", never existed before, not like nature, these are not natural. But when it comes to safety, they say: it's just like nature, exactly as nature made. I sometimes call this ontological schizophrenia.""*

Again, the documentary linked in my first post will shed more light on the matter.

> Loss of necessary diversity of seeds.

This part is, if anything, even worse than all the rest because it puts market principles and our own food security at risk. Basically, no one is asking for these GM crops : they're new, untested, have bad PR and tried-and-true methods of hybridization make them redundant. Their only interest is that you can put a patent on them. So you're a big corporation intent on making a fortune with biotechnologies, what do you do? 

Well, it seems that after a good dose of fraudulent marketing, you just buy as much of the competition as you can and make them sell your crap, and *only that*. You intimidate farmers who won't play ball with lawsuits over contamination and buy off the legislators in third world countries (never a hard sell, that one). Once you have a monopoly, too bad if your new technology sucks, you're the only game left in town. Then you rake in the profits while everyone eats your shit.

People who hide behind free market principles just don't understand how the world works. Capitalism, unchecked, isn't about competition, it's about profits. When are profits maximized? When you have a monopoly. That's the game Monsanto is playing, not ""let the best guy win"". 

The problem isn't that their lawyers don't understand the technology (more to the point, they don't care), it's that their scientists don't understand economic strategy.

One story in The World According To Monsanto shows how a cotton plant modified by this technique lost its defense against a common fungus, destroying entire recolts and bringing hundred of little farms to ruin in India.

So the gene introduction method is entirely irrelevant to to the outcomes you described (destroying other genes, overwriting, recombining etc.).  These affects are a property of the plant itself, and they also occur with comparable frequency anytime a plant is genetically altered by non-GMO techniques, (such as hybridization, or random mutagenisis in the field).  The only reason this made news with the farm in India is because it involved the new technology.  The outcome was not new at all.  Look up the history of the [Gros Michel banana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana) for instance.  The linked wikipedia article does not do the story justice I'm afraid, but I don't have time to find better.

The point is that when you talk to scientists, you will find very quickly that we never speak in absolutes, and that we are trained to consider everything as possible.  So yes, while it is possible that GMOs may have some special undiscovered property that could destroy the Earth, that possibility is no more likely than it would be coming from any other plant.  I don't have a vested interest in GMO foods, I'm simply trying to think about the unknown risks vs the benefits in a reasonable way.

With that said, I think the substantial equivalence concept is not a bad one honestly and in fact I think it is one that should be applied much more broadly to _all_ new cultivars of any kind regardless of their method of generation, be it GM, hybridization, cloning from clippings, wild isolates or whatever.  Again, no such principle is applied to crops developed using these other older technologies (not even new cultivars, like the baby watermelons), only GMOs are, and that is where the claim that GMOs are the most scrutinized come from.  If that claim were not true, there wouldn't even be a controversy about the concept of Substantial Equivalence.

Moving on, the Vandava Shiva quoted comparison isn't exactly fair.  If you have a brand new and cheaper way of making a mousetrap, functionally the same same mousetrap that has existed for 100 years, wouldn't you think that new way of making the ""new"" mousetrap would be patentable and valuable?

>Basically, no one is asking for these GM crops

Not true.  The farmers love these crops.  They are aware that they do not always improve yields, but that isn't the main reason they want them.  They like them because, even with the idiotic licensing scheme required, Round-Up Ready crops save farmers money.  But that gets us back to your first point, in this topic which was..

>it puts market principles and our own food security at risk

...which is another discussion entirely.  You are quite right that the root of all of this is not the technology but the economical model we have chosen in this country to ensure a steady and growing supply of food.  I too am not convinced that capitalism is the best model for agricultural economics, but as long as it is, every and any technology available that even has a chance of improving yield or lowering cost will be attempted.  We could argue endlessly about whether that is a good thing or not, and the root of that discussion comes to our own ideas about whether continued slow growth of humanity is better than capping growth to preserve current resources.  I don't even know how I feel about that discussion yet, but it has implications much bigger than food and GMOs.

>Well, it seems that after a good dose of fraudulent marketing, you just buy as much of the competition as you can and make them sell your crap, and only that.

Once you have a monopoly, too bad if your new technology sucks, you're the only game left in town. Then you rake in the profits while everyone eats your shit.

OK now you are treading just a little too far into the world of hyperbole.  There are many many companies that sell seeds for every kind of crop in both GMO and non-GMO varieties and they are all competing with each other.  Cargill, ADM, Dow Agro, Dupont Cropsci, as well as the hundreds of mid- and small-cap vendors.  The idea that any country is under the threat of monopoly exploitation is fantasy.  Please provide me references for this.  Also, you should scroll through some of my other comments about the contamination issue.  While i do think that Monsanto is insane for selling their seeds under the licensing model that they do, I do not think that any of the cases which have gone to court were at all related to ""contamination"", which scientifically is vastly less likely a cause of the observed ""contamination"" than theft.  ""Theft"" again being more of a technical term to mean, ""violating Monsato's license"" which again, I think is idiotic anyway.  The problem for Monsanto, is that due to the nature of agriculture, it has been impossible for them to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any theft actually occurred and that cross-pollination could not have occurred.  Therefore, since Monsanto lost these suits, the ""truth"" most people have come to believe reflects the story of the defense, no matter how scientifically unlikely that story may be.

>People who hide behind free market principles just don't understand how the world works. Capitalism, unchecked, isn't about competition, it's about profits. When are profits maximized? When you have a monopoly. That's the game Monsanto is playing, not ""let the best guy win"".

I agree entirely, and this points back to my earlier comment on the subject.  I don't know if communism on the extreme is any better, but I am a strong supporter of government-mediated regulation of industry in general to prevent monopolization.  The US government has not done a very good job of this in recent years, but I don't think it is fair to put GMOs technology in the crossfire.  I'm supportive of putting Monsanto and their business practices there, but not the GMO technology they sell.

>The problem isn't that their lawyers don't understand the technology (more to the point, they don't care), it's that their scientists don't understand economic strategy.

OMG please don't make me get a Ph. D. in Law or Economics as well.  Getting the first Ph. D. sucked so bad I'd kill myself if I had to do it again.  Listen, in a perfect world I would be an expert in everything and I would never have a need to delegate responsibility for any decision or action I made to anyone else ever.  But this is fantasy.  I'm human, I can't do it all.  It doesn't matter whether I'm working on an a-bomb, or a nuclear plant, or a radium-linked cancer drug.  I only have enough in me to be able to do the research and for the deeper questions you are alluding to I have to have some degree of faith that everyone I'm working with enjoys humanity as much as I do, and won't seek to use my spiffy new tools for evil.  I would argue that any scientist needs to know enough about the potential uses of his new tool to make a guess about how much benefit they may generate.  Few scientists think it a good idea to do research on anthrax for instance, even though I'm sure such research could generate some very fascinating information.  By the same token, any lawyer worth his salt should understand enough biology and agricultural science to be able to tell if the licensing agreement they are drafting makes a damn bit of sense or not.  Again, I think the Monsanto scientists have done their jobs and did the right thing.  The lawyers have not.
