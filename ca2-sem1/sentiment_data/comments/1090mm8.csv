Welcome to r/science! This is a heavily moderated subreddit in order to keep the discussion on science.

1090mm8,0,"Study (open access): [Exotic alleles contribute to heat tolerance in wheat under field conditions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04325-5)
___________________

>**Abstract**

>Global warming poses a major threat to food security and necessitates the development of crop varieties that are resilient to future climatic instability. By evaluating 149 spring wheat lines in the field under yield potential and heat stressed conditions, we demonstrate how strategic integration of exotic material significantly increases yield under heat stress compared to elite lines, with no significant yield penalty under favourable conditions. Genetic analyses reveal three exotic-derived genetic loci underlying this heat tolerance which together increase yield by over 50% and reduce canopy temperature by approximately 2 °C. We identified an Ae. tauschii introgression underlying the most significant of these associations and extracted the introgressed Ae. tauschii genes, revealing candidates for further dissection. Incorporating these exotic alleles into breeding programmes could serve as a pre-emptive strategy to produce high yielding wheat cultivars that are resilient to the effects of future climatic uncertainty.",0,,,2,science

1090mm8,1,"As there's already gluten free methods of baking I would suspect not (though you never know). It doesn't really make sense to though. Gluten plays such a critical role in baked goods... it's essential. When gluten proteins are activated through water and kneading, they start to bind with one another becoming longer and longer chains, giving rise to an increasingly elastic nature, trapping the gases produced by the yeast so that the dough can rise. Certain wheats contain more gluten than others (strong vs weak flour) but they each have their purpose from breads, pastries, pizza, etc.",0,,,2,science
