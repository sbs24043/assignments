dhpj8d,2,"Not inherently. Yield is a complex trait.

> It is just not all that difficult to re-hab soil. Farmers have been doing it pretty much for all of recorded history, and before. 

Farmers are losing soil, not gaining it.  Maybe farmers are just not doing those easy things?

>The average rate of soil erosion from cropland decreased by over 30 percent from 1982 to 2012, 17 the last year for which NRI data are available (Figure 3), largely due to the adoption of reduced tillage management by a growing number of farmers. Despite this improvement, the current estimated rate of erosion (an average of 4.6 tons per acre per year18) results in significant soil losses. These estimated losses are not evenly distributed, with some areas of the country still experiencing average losses of nearly twice that amount",0,,,1,science

I'll make a small comparison to golden rice, where the nutrition standards don't meet US guidelines, but rice isn't a staple of the US diet; however, in countries where people eat lots of rice daily, it is giving them enough of what they need (I think specifically vitamin A?) so that things like rates in blindness are decreasing rapidly.",0,,,0,science
