this happens in a greenhouse, not outside. all of those experiments occur in greenhouses, where the temperature is controlled (and @77F.)  you ignored the temperature data (on purpose.)

Please refer to the Mauna Loa levels for atmospheric CO2. It shows the background levels on an island in the ocean. This is lower than the actual levels on the continents. It is well known that the seas absorb CO2 rapidly as the gas passes offshore.

Is it some secret prohibition that causes CO2 not to be used to form sugars?

How can I ask this in any other way?


Ok about your temperature claim that above 77 degrees that plants cannot convert nutrients to more mass and will require more water and CO2 but not grow. REALLY? You actually believe this?
I own property in Florida and have seen the crops growing around LaBelle. Using 3x the growing season as in the North. Try telling this to the Brazilians who are fueling their cars with ethanol derived from sugarcane. You are absolutely wrong about crops not responding above 77 degrees. 
Gouvea et al. (2009) used the agrometeorological model of Doorenbos and Kassam (1994) ""to estimate sugarcane yield in tropical southern Brazil, based on future A1B climatic scenarios presented in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report,"" first calculating potential productivity, which considers ""the possible impacts caused by changes in temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, as well as technological advances,"" and then actual productivity, which additionally accounts for the yield-reducing effects of water stress.

Based on the calculations, Gouvea et al. determined that ""potential productivity will increase by 15% in relation to the present condition in 2020, by 33% in 2050 and by 47% in 2080,"" and that ""actual productivity will increase by 12% in relation to the present condition in 2020, by 32% in 2050 and by 47% in 2080."" Of these productivity gains, they further indicate that the portions due to expected technological advances, including the development of new varieties and best management practices, will account for 35% of the yield gains in 2020, 51% in 2050, and 61% in 2080.

Explain why plants outside a greenhouse cannot use enhanced CO2 in the atmosphere to form sugars and plants inside can use enhanced levels to do so. 

I gave a link that quite clearly shows that the present vegetation index worldwide show enhanced growth...particularly in the Sahel.

Explain why there is more growth now with the supposed increase in temperature and increased CO2.

Corn Crops have increased from 95 bushels/acre to 150 bushels/acre.
The ""high temperatures"" are simply negated by better yields from shifting crop planting dates and using heat tolerant hybrids. There is absolutely no drop off in corn production and the temperatures do not follow an absolute 77 degree cutoff in growth as you imply. A wide variety of plants have different optimum temperatures.

[This study](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/300/5625/1560.abstract) shows the growth in vegetation due to CO2. Please note that the majority is in the tropics. That kind of knocks your theory of no enhanced growth over 77 degrees.

> Then tell me how the CO2 levels measured there do not provide plants with the carbon and oxygen portions of the sugars. Is it some secret prohibition that causes CO2 not to be used to form sugars?

As has already been pointed out, there are limiting factors on the efficiency of photosynthesis *other* than CO2 and temperature. Take a plant that prefers the soil found in New England and transplant it into a greenhouse with the clay-dominated soil found in the Southeastern USA, and I guarantee you - no matter how high you crank up the CO2, that plant is not going to grow or thrive.

Everything else you argue is a strawman.

The Science article you link to has been superseded in the past 8 years. It's hallmark result - that the Amazon will flourish in a warmer climate - is hotly contested right now; most modeling studies (including one that I'm personally in the process of publishing) indicate that shifts in other climatic factors such as precipitation will dominate the carbon cycle's response in this portion of the world, resulting in the Amazon actually dramatically diminishing in size and efficiency as a CO2 sink. In fact, there is every indication that because of deforestation and regional climate change, the Amazon will become a net CO2 source to the atmosphere, thereby initiating a quick and fast but large positive feedback in the climate system.",0,,,0,science
h6wir,6,"Fact is that neither you nor I nor anyone else is going to reverse the situation of consuming products that produce CO2.
The CO2 in the atmosphere will continue to incresae with outgassing of the oceans and continued use of fossil fuels. Those marginal areas of crop production will see increases or decreases as the climate changes. The Sahel is green. Where for centuries there was nothing but sand there are now pastures and bushes sufficient for agriculture.

Climate change cuts both ways and the alarmism being shouted about is specious. Warmer temperatures have always been more advantageous for crop production. If not one crop then another more appropriate crop.

This study wants to assume that all crop producing land is marginal in some respect and will experience crop failure if a minor change ....like (.25 degrees over 30 years) occurs. Planting of crops can be varied to overcome minor variations in temperature if such variations make any difference at all.

Take a look at the crops produced in the world and tell me where there is a major failure in crop production. What you are seeing are normal variations year to year with increased yields.

This has nothing to do with the reality of global warming or atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Hell, one could have a value system which *urges enhanced emissions of CO2* and at the same time they could recognize what science dictates the consequences of that action are.

> The Sahel is green. Where for centuries there was nothing but sand there are now pastures and bushes sufficient for agriculture.

Terraforming by humans is not the same thing as regional climate change, and it is **very** difficult to predict what individual regions in the world will experience in terms of altered growing seasons and precipitation in response to climate change. There is *no* reason to assume they will be unaffected.

> Climate change cuts both ways and the alarmism being shouted about is specious.

Then why are you insisting it will be all grand and that increased CO2 -> increased ecosystem productivity, even as others indicate that this is a false argument?

> Warmer temperatures have always been more advantageous for crop production.

Demonstrably incorrect. as a [cursory reading of the ""Famine"" article on Wikipedia illustrates a history of many crop failures due to heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine#Historical_famine.2C_by_region).

>  Planting of crops can be varied to overcome minor variations in temperature if such variations make any difference at all.

Once more, and as others have called you out on, **temperature isn't the only variable changing here**. Precipitation and other factors are changing, and those changes have major impacts on nutrient availability, especially in the soil which itself responds to climate change as well due to temperature and precipitation fluctuations.

> Mankind starves in lower temperature and lives well in warmer temperatures, Due primarily to heightened availability of food production. Grain production in Northern Africa during the Roman Warm Period is one example. This is not a strawman, it is historical fact.

No, this is another strawman and a sleight of hand. Mankind has thrived in the *relatively stable climate of the Anthropocene*. Although there have been climate fluctuations which have had major impacts on civilization, the climate hasn't shifted dramatically for a sustained period of time in the past ~4000 years. **Both up/downswings in temperature have induced major hardship and agricultural failure across the globe**. 

What we're talking about with *climate change* is a departure from the climatic optimum of the past few millenia within which human civilization has thrived. If you assume that your expected ""weather"" is pulled from a distribution of possible values called ""climate"", then what we're talking about is translation of distribution's mean and a change in its variance. We'll get *more* extreme events (in terms of magnitude), and events which are currently ""extreme"" now will become more commonplace. 

It's just flat out intellectually dishonest to try to boil it down to ""temperatures go up, CO2 goes up so plant productivity goes up"".

???The Sahel has not been changed by deliberate terraforming.
It is not difficult to hind cast a known observed change. 

You say that The Wiki Article shows many crop failures due to heat. Not correct, A few crop failures are attributed to heatwaves. (without sufficient rainfall no doubt) Most of the others are from **Drought.**
Drought that occurred long before Climate alarmism reared its ugly head. (Of course any change now is immediately blamed on climate change).
 Some few are from mismanagement by socialist/communist planned governments acting centrally rather then allowing the farmers to control the farming. 
Precipitation and other factors have always been in play for farmers.
I suppose you have never heard of the dust bowl? Temperatures were high then and the rainfall sparse. No CO2 alarmism though.
The Holocene has provided higher temperatures [than at present](http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/histo1.png) given that the report in question here projects another 3 decades at the preent rate of increase in temperature or 50% higher....... The total increase would still be less than 7/10ths of a degree.

 Periods of the Holocene were warmer. [datahere](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/gisp2/isotopes/gisp2_temp_accum_alley2000.txt) You can attempt to calculate the actual temperature shifts above **PRESENT**.
If you cannot and canot see that your statement is wrong...I have quite a number of other studies worldwide that can present the same information. Your claim of greatly increased temperatures above the warmer periods in the last 10,000 years is false and the paper itself does not predict those temperatures will be exceeded. Less than 1 degree C change over a period of 60 years is what the prediction was. multiple studies have shown warmer temperatures in the past.

Oh and farmers have varied planting practices for thousands of years to allow optimum production of crops. To insist that they are soooooo stupid and some one who has probably never planted a field is soooooo smart is ludicrous.

I have no idea how they could have done this without micro data from a range of countries - eg Libya, from the map - which are not noted for their statistics. Water is being diverted to urban use in many countries, meaning that irrigation prices are going up. That reduces water use (and drainage) leading to salinization and through both mechanisms, lower yields. 

The temperature signal is at best equivocal - half a degree in interannual fluctuation that is much greater - so finding the direct signal from this is not easy. Evapotranspiration trends globally have no secular signal.  

I await teh paer with interest, if to see no more than how they have managed to get around these issues.There have been hundreds of papers that extrapolate from major differences in temperature in a phytotron to tiny ones in the field and then used GCMs to estimate or deem a temperature that ought to be there, so as to have a signal for the deemed effect to respond.

They cannot have it both ways either there was a reduction in crop yield or there was an increase in crop yield. To claim a reduction in crop yield when there were actually increases in yields ( but not as much as their models predicted) is the big lie.
