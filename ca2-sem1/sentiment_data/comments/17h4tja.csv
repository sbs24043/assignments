17h4tja,0,"The amount you get is combination of crop yield, fertility dependence, how much your farmers manage to nourish the farm and some other variable. *(I did a small test and tried running on a few fields size 100 wheat and medicinal herbs. 1 field each type on 100% fertility and 1 field each type on 70% fertility.)*

The crop yield is the base amount which is then increased by fertility dependence. It is then changed based on the fertility of land you are on and fertility dependence changes the effect of fertility itself.

*(Fun fact if the farmers manage to nourish the field to 100% nourishment they will start harvest before the early autumn. And by messing around I found out, that if the field is small enough the farmer can replant and nourish the field 2 times (total) before autumn comes. But I did not test it enough to say if small many fields is better than big one field for higher dificulties.)*

Math example (the formula is simplified and does not have all the variables, I am just trying to explain the principle):

Let's set field to 100.

Wheat has 72% yield and 90% dependence.

Cabbage has 65% yield and 70% dependence.

So you should get 100 \* 72% = 72 units of wheat and 100 \* 65% = 65 units of cabbage on perfect fertility.

If we make it on lets say 70% fertility land, it gets lower.

Wheat 72 \* (100% - (100%-70%)\*90%) = 52,56 => 53

Cabbage 65 \* (100% - (100%-70%)\*70%) = 51,35 => 51

These numbers are then multiplied by how much nourishment % your farmers managed to do.

17h4tja,1,"Does the dependence work the other way too?
So for 100% fertility growing cabbage:

65 x (100/70) = 92",0,,,1,kingdomsreborn
17h4tja,2,"~~It does work the other way but it would be more akin to something like this~~

~~65 \* (100+(100−70)) ÷ 100 = 78~~
