I only know of 4 or 5 market garden- type farms near me.  They all seem to fight each other for business locally.",0,,,103,farming
12uqvu8,1,I just dont understand why you wouldnt diversify and build up small with better cash crops.,0,,,12,farming
12uqvu8,2,"Labor is my reason. I could raise the funds for equipment but I don’t have dependable help. I tried hay on old cotton land but I’d have to do it full time to make it profitable. It seems like everything that is profitable requires a full time commitment. I have lots of other time commitments on the farm that i would have to hand over or give up to make money on something else. So, I rent out a portion of the land to traditional cotton farmers and that money allows me to run a nice homestead. I think lots of people in my shoes are choosing to turn their crop land into a homestead that doesn’t necessarily make money but makes them feel good. 

All that said, we offer a scholarship for people to use our land for experimental agricultural ideas. Think FFA projects or 4-H gardens. I’d love for someone to offer me more in rent to grow garlic rather than cotton. The moment someone offers a cent more, I’ll diversify my cotton land.",0,,,52,farming
12uqvu8,2,"Because you need a market FOR EACH AND EVERY CROP.  That's the problem with all of your plans.

High value markets don't appear out of thin air, they can take years to develop and minutes to ruin.  If you just want to grow stuff and sell it, you're going to get wholesale prices which absolutely do not equal retail prices.

Think about corn for a second.  There are farms selling field corn for $1/ear as squirrel corn, $5 corn stalk bundles, $20 bags of deer corn, etc.  Why doesn't everyone do that?  Because the market would become oversaturated extremely quickly and prices would plummet.  That is true with just about any specialty product.",0,,,57,farming

12uqvu8,2,"Farming since the 60's was anti-diversification. You were told over and over, through the banks, government, and whomever else, to specialize and go big. Before that, subsistence farming had every farm doing a little bit of everything and doing it kind of poorly with maybe a few crops and livestock eventually making it's way to market. In Wisconsin, Dairy was king, so Dad got rid of every animal that wasn't a cow and didn't grow anything that couldn't feed cows.  It was a bit of an over correction, but there's a little merit to not trying to do everything that comes along.",0,,,23,farming

12uqvu8,2,Govt Farm programs don't cover crop failures for garlic and other garden crops. Market is another one. There is an elevator to take corn. You have to work to find a buyer for garlic.,0,,,2,farming
12uqvu8,0,"Specialty crops require specialty equipment, which is very expensive to purchase, maintain, and repair. Markets are volatile, and require a great deal of legwork to break into. Plus, purchasers and packers make contracts on volume. You can grow a few acres of something, that's fine. But packers are going to want steady, year-round supply. They don't buy a pallet of something from you and cut a cheque. 

So now you need a scale of economy, plus high-quality storage facilities to keep your product for a year (harvest to harvest continuity). Even the best storage facilities don't keep everything perfect, and on an annual storage you can probably expect 20-30 grade-out over the course of a year.

Can you do it? Absolutely you can, lots of people do. Is it worth it? That's up to you. A single farmer can farm many quarters of land almost on their own with something like grain or corn. It takes dozens of hands to grow most vegetable and specialty crops. You have to hand-weed most vegetable crops, which at any viable scale is going to take a ton of time. A field small enough to not require hired help isn't going to produce enough for serious packers to look twice.

Of course it can be done, or nobody would do it, but the cost of equipment and labor eats into your margins pretty quick. There is no form of ""get-rich-quick"" farming. The farmers you see pulling expensive boats behind fancy trucks probably have *millions* of dollars of debt.",0,,,65,farming

12uqvu8,7,"This is the sort of thing thats hard for me to comprehend. I've watched friends just dump SO much food because they couldn't sell it right away. With some crops like tomatoes it makes sense because they just dont keep and require a LOT of work to make shelf stable, but with stuff like garlic, I would think you could make garlic powder or flakes or whatever to be able to sell as a value added shelf stable product. Obviously it would add some work and requires a little more resources, which I'm sure is why it doesn't get done as often. But man, it seems so much better to put that little bit of time and effort to not entirely miss out on any profits from your crop.    
I guess a lot of people don't want to / can't put that extra work in after harvest and marketing unsuccessfully. I work on 2 small, diverse farms, and we try and use or sell pretty much everything we can, even if we end up selling some things at a way discounted rate before it goes bad. I'm working on my business plan for my very small farm and doing stuff to make profit off everything you can just seems to make sense, but I guess maybe/probably not on a larger scale.. idk",0,,,3,farming
12uqvu8,8,"Yeah these friends didn’t have the resources to turn the garlic into powder or flakes, and couldn’t even find a buyer at a discounted rate. There was no other option for them and in the end it had gone bad. Really sad, they almost lost their farms with that loss but luckily had a very good year this past year to recover a little bit.",0,,,3,farming
12uqvu8,8,"You should probably look into what sort of equipment would be needed to convert that garlic into powder or flakes.   It requires very expensive processing and packaging equipment. When I say expensive, I'm talking in the million dollar and up range.  You also have to consider the regulations when packaging a product for commercial sales.  Food packing plants are regulated and inspected by the FDA and state regulators as well.  You also have to realize that they normally sell their crops to companies who are in the business of further processing of their product for sale.  If they are in that business already and don't have a market, then you probably won't be any more successful than they are after you have invested the extra time and money. It's very easy to come up with ideas, but very rarely are those ideas easy to implement in a real-world situation.",0,,,2,farming

We do asparagus, cucumbers, and peppers. The gross amount we make is insanely high and the costs we pay out are also insane. But it sounds like you don’t want to hire much labour so those crops aren’t for you as we have to hire around 50 field labourers every year.",0,,,6,farming
12uqvu8,8,"The big bonus to corn, soybeans, wheat, etc is that it can all mostly be done with same equipment. With a planter, drill, and combine you can plant and harvest a huge variety of crops. Vegetables tend to take specialized equipment per crop. We bale alfalfa and use Case IH square balers. We have two Case dealers within 30 minutes of us but neither work on balers because alfalfa isn't grown much in our area. If we need baler parts and service, it's a 4 hour drive one way. We make good money on it because we're the only ones doing it. If everyone started growing alfalfa, then the price would plummet. 

Dad tried growing popcorn in the 80's. Turns out all the nearest movie theaters already had purchase contracts from big time dealers. Nearest place he could off load it was 6 hours away and that drive ate up his profits. Another neighbor tried sunflower seeds. Same issue, nowhere close enough to sell. Another tried growing shrimp. He took an old hog shed, gutted it, filled it with inflatable walmart pools and had mature shrimp ready to go each month. He sold to nearby bars and restaurants but they couldn't buy enough to make it profitable. He tried to expand, but all the restaurants in the bigger cities a few hours away already had their stuff contracted. Neatest canning facility was 14 hours away on the coast.

Corn market is based on futures contracts and you can make good money there too since you can physically settle contracts.

Zero.

1000 pounds off of 500 plants is actually a really low yield for cherry tomatoes, had I started them early properly and fertilized them more often (really just taken better care of them in general, like watering, trellising, weeding, pesticides, scheduled harvesting, etc.) They would have likely yielded 10 pounds per plant, which would've been nearly 5k pounds of cherry tomatoes on a tenth of an acre.

12uqvu8,0,"There are a few reasons why:

First off, markets for corn and grain are worldwide markets that are extremely large. Storage of these commodities is relatively cheap and the equipment to grow corn/grain is common. Parts are easy to source; machinery will inevitably break, even with the very best maintenance.

Secondly, ROTATION. I can rotate grain crops with the equipment I have. I know garlic was used as an example and I haven't read your business plan, but you can't just grow garlic year after year on the same plot of land and expect to get a crop, instead you will get disease. So you will need to simultaneously break into multiple markets and buy multiple lines of equipment for each specialty. These specialty markets aren't an easy nut to crack and rely heavily on established relationships.

Another issue is quality. Grocery store items generally need to look a certain way. Misshapen or diseased produce has almost no market anywhere, so only your best produce will make money. I've seen piles and piles of carrots that were left to compost because they didn't meet aestethic criteria. Animal feed is a money losing proposition for specialty crops and is only used to recuperate some of the cost.

Finally, as many have said, farm labour shortages are a real thing and good help is hard to find.

Veggies, I might be able to get to a distributor 20-50 miles away, and if they even want it, they'd pay on par with the stuff they import in from Cali or wherever else. Less if there's any packaging or quality concerns on their end -they want timely market ready produce. And they'll lowball the shit out of the price if they have too much on hand already. 

Scaling up is the biggest hurdle. A few boxes or a pickup load, pretty easy to offload at a farmer's market, the side of the road, or even local grocers at a good price for most of it. Semi-trucks, also not that hard because you're dealing directly with bigger distributors and processors to deliver the quantity and low prices they're set up for. Nobody wants to deal with the middle guy anymore- half dozen pallets of produce. You're either producing way too much for a farmer's market with labor intensive methods, or you're way too small to fully mechanize and deliver cheap enough to the bigger distributors.

It takes a while to ramp up to find your markets so thinking you can plant 5 acres of a vegetable and reliably sell it off the bat is dubious. 
Consumer trends are another part of the equation where the average person in the States is eating out 70% of the time and most of the food bought at the grocery is processed from corn and soybean byproducts making the demand for those two crops absurd.

Garlic requires the right soils, the right conditions, labor intensive picking, prep, drying etc, this is true of most/all specialty crops. The reason they are typically grown on small farms is because it is manageable to do so

I've seen this happen.  In 2009 we had $10 contracts and within 3 years I sold my overage that I couldn't contract for $1.75.

Plus the marketing is very hard.  You have to know people to sell your product too and there aren't as many middle men as there use to be.  You might not be able to move the produce before it rots.  Sometimes if they don't know you or if you go to the wrong church you they wont buy from you.  You can only move a few hundred pounds at a farmers market  and that's if they even let you setup, if there is another garlic guy he will blackball you and not let you have booth.

I've seen whole crops get sold to the feedlot and the farm goes broke.  God like most of the guys I rent ground from used to be spud farmers and they had open potatoes in 1996 and lost their ass not being able to move their product.

Even then… if no demand, no market… Your best bet is to get in right with a local distributor, or start your own and start building relationships with regional grocers and buyers for chains. Your job will become sales, the farming side is not the hard part, at least at first. Once the market opens and you’re having to compete with other farmers, then you have to compete on yield/efficiency/quality and the farming side gets pressured and you start the boom/bust cycle that exists in almost all crops.

12uqvu8,0,"Corn and soybeans are safe-ish bets in the current American food paradigm. There is a lot of technology surrounding them and there is a broad market for them. They have low production costs.

Speciality crops could gross and maybe even net more per acre but the risk is higher and the market isn't as broad. More specialized and less available equipment as well.

Finally, I know lots of market gardeners are pushing $100k an acre... but one acre is tiny. One herd of deer in one night, one tornado. Heck, one groundhog could eat %10 of your gross in a night. 200 acres of corn is a hedge against some of those risks.",0,,,3,farming

And we have Tyson, an ethanol plant, and two different co-op that buy corn within 30 miles.

Zero markets for garlic right out of the field so there's storage cost and shrinkage, and significant transportation and marketing coat.

But if y'all are getting rich off garlic I say good for you.  If we all plant garlic though, the price will tank as supply exceeds demand.

I don't think those states will have the soil temperature to support the germination, so you are left with a field full of ungerminated garlic.

That's the best I can gather.

 I've seen a lot of that on YouTube.  A lot of guys like Fortier, Curtis Stone, and whatnot.  They seem to have a workable formula of high density, high rotation crops on super small plots of land.  It's just a lot of manual work and it's requires access to a nearby population center to sell directly into.  

It's probably about the most reasonable way I could see of someone starting from scratch, but I don't really see how that model helps someone with a existing larger farm, especially in the middle of nowhere.

12uqvu8,2,"Rising costs of operation make it completely non-feasible relative to return.   I didn’t inherit my land like my neighbors did.  It’s impossible to justify pulling equity out of our land like they do in order to stay in (hopefully in the future) a barely break even business.  If it wasn’t currently a tax deduction against our other income, I would sell it in a heartbeat.  You can only lose money like that for so long.

12uqvu8,0,"A farmer near me did this with Hemp a few years ago when CBD was blowing up. 
He planted 5 acres in it, and had a buyer lined up for something like $60/lb, he was estimating to make around $350k or something. 
He bought some specialty equipment, spent the summer walking the fields to pick out any males and hand weeded it. Harvested it, hung it to dry and it wouldn’t dry down as quick as he had planned to. By the time it was ready the buyer had filled their order and he was stuck with it. Ended up selling it for $2/lb. 
He’s back to wheat now, making money with less work.",0,,,1,farming

12uqvu8,0,"It’s like planting hemp in Iowa.  Need specialty equipment, special rules, different ways to harvest, difficult to transport, and no market.   18 months ago there were stories of Midwest farmers making bank on hemp.  It’s just not true.   

It’s like organic corn—lots of rules, less yields and lots of transportation to get to the special market, unless it’s in your area.",0,,,1,farming
12uqvu8,0,"Plus, corn and beans have been proven to be safe markets and hearty crops that can typically withstand most weather and pests.  There is also crop insurance for corn and beans, so one bad season/weather won’t wipe you out.   Does insurance exist for all the niche crops?  
 
And it’s not really diversifying to lower risk—it’s actually adding risk/time.  Why not put cattle on that 20 acres?  It’s really not that much different than what you describe.  Lots of new equipment, lots of new inputs, more time/labor etc.",0,,,1,farming
12uqvu8,1,There is whole farm revenue insurance (in the USA) most diversified specialty crop farms are boxed out due to detailed reporting on the inputs expenses and yield for each variety. A simplified version exists for whole farm revenue below a $100k but a producer still needs 5-7 years of production history.,0,,,1,farming
12uqvu8,0,"My area. It would be a mix of insurance and market. Transportation is a big issue and there is only some for certain crops, the area is canola and to grow something like corn as it’s not something that grows well here would be a massive undertaking and on top of that insurance wouldn’t even touch you.  Canola however you get get a decent crop, get it to market and you will make some money. Not as much as someone that grew corn and could get it to market. But it’s more stable. I think that could be a factor. People and companies like safe. New things scare them and it’s a gamble a lot won’t do.",0,,,1,farming
12uqvu8,0,"It depends on many factors. Curtis Stone always talks about context. To know what the (local) market wants and what customers are willing to pay for. Getting a high price means having to spend a lrge amount og time building relationships.

Economy of scale? Before or after expenses?  Organic or non organic? Factchecked numbers? 

There is good money to be made growing a larger variety of crops, perhaps even enough to put away a nest egg. But it is hard work, and when growing at a smaller scale you income might be more succeptible to unforseeenbdistruptions it might be harder to recover from. 
On the other hand growing a larger variety and rotation might also give a more robust yield, and less disease pressure.",0,,,1,farming
12uqvu8,0,"I do food safety for some specialty farms and I can tell you that the food safety and the equipment/infrastructure is MILES away from a corn/grain farm. It’s daunting. 


Vegetables are great but the upfront cost of the storages and equipment is 1 hurdle, but then you have the chemistry/fungicide rotation and tillage practices that make vegetables possible which are usually also VERY different. THEN you have the whole processor/end user/food safety side of things. 


The guy doing spuds and the onion guy down the road have completely different equipment. Then the beet guys have different harvesters, then the celery guy has all different stuff too, maybe he overlaps with the guy growing carrots a bit but that’s it. 


Some farms who have been growing spuds for 50 years are struggling to find seed stock that is disease free and good quality, some farms are putting up little green houses to grow their own seed stock for the garlic/celery/potatoes which gives them some reliability but also = $$$ more infrastructure costs.",0,,,1,farming

12uqvu8,2,"What?? No. Seed stock is a single year yield, there’s no carry over.  Variety and demand changes very quickly (have you heard of Covid? Well the restaurant vs french fries vs chip demand is ALWAYS changing, and variety and volumes follow). 


You are clearly very undereducated in this topic to be so negative and nit-picky about it.  


Oh, and finally - $100K per acre is a gross over estimate for a majority of specialty crops - especially annually cultivated crops. Organic onions can get you ~$40K/acre, which of course organic poses it’s own challenges.",0,,,0,farming
12uqvu8,3,"Are we being silly and saying 40k instead of 100k because of profit margins? Yeah dude ya got me, to make 100k an acre you need to spend probably around half. Shit I’ve been bested

Also how is that a “no they carry seed stock over” when the seed stock is diseased? You said yourself many farms cannot get disease free seed stock 💁🏼‍♂️

And when you solve the mystery to storing spuds for 24 months you call me because THEN you’d be onto something.


Edit to explain because apparently this is an ELI5 now:  there is no carry over on spud seed because (surprise) potatoes have a shelf life. They’ll sprout or rot in the bin. The disease issue is completely separate from the fact that potatoes WILL NOT store.",0,,,2,farming

Most row crop farms already own the equipment so you only have maintenance costs. 
Some form of profit is almost guaranteed in row crop farming. You already know what your yields will average and crop insurance in case they don't. You also can pre-sale the crop for ne t year or even years down the road. Going into a speciality you can't do any of this. Now as far as scale, if you make say $20 per acre profit on 100 acres you made $2000. On 1,000 acres $20,000. On 10,000 acres $200,000. Throw in the fact you do a lot of your own labor means more hours for you. Many farmers may make a total as low as 3 passes over the ground plus spraying. You can farm 10,000 acres with 1 tractor, 1 planter, 1 light tillage tool, 1 grain cart, 1 semi, 1 combine, and a corn and bean head.",0,,,1,farming
