That is simply not true. Sure, they claim that, in the same way that anti-vaxers claim to be ""pro safe vaccine"", and creationists claim to want to ""teach the controversy"". No testing will ever be enough to put the fears at ease, because it isn't about testing, it is about an ideological opposition to a loosely defined set of technologies. If it weren't, the demand would not be about the testing needed for GM, but about testing needed for each of the breeding techniques used, GM or not. GM techniques is simply not a cohesive enough group, nor are they distinct enough from other breeding techniques, for it to make sense to demand one level of testing for GMO and another for every other breeding technique.

>When it boils down to it this is just another collision of the US regulatory norm of doing basically nothing and letting people sue later compared to the EUs ""no prove it safe before we start"" mentality.

> I'm typically pro-patents however we are pretty close to monoculture crops for certain varieties

Monoculture is a problem, but it is one that GM can help alleviate. Since the traits introduced with GM reside in on or a few genes, it is much easier to back-cross it into other lines, compared to traits obtained from traditional breeding. So it is much easier to get a broad variety of cultivars with desirable traits if those traits come from GM than if they come from traditional breeding.",0,,,10,science

In many heavy agricultural states, including my home state of Indiana, biotech has actually *reduced* monoculture by indirectly increasing the overall yield, reducing crop loss, and reducing pesticide usage, which gives farmers more of a safety net to grow other crops.

It took 12 years to build Palo Verde which output 32 GWh of electricity in 2017 (and could go up to 38 without any modification). California has installed solar faster than any other state and has been doing so for far longer than 12 years, yet all of that solar only produced 24 GWh of electricity in 2017.

You could argue that ""some"" of the solar came online sooner, but that strategy is like running from a bear on foot instead of getting in the car and driving away, just because the car takes a moment longer to start and you're too busy running scared already. Despite what certain politicians owned by renewable lobbyists might say (and yes, solar billionaire Tom Steyer is the #1 donor to the Democrat party), the actual climate science does not indicate that the world is ending in 12 years.

But nuclear power sources last a very long time, and that cost is really only realized for a brief period of the overall return of energy.

What is the effect of uranium mining? Nuclear fuel from fresh uranium is cheaper than from recycled uranium or recycled plutonium (MOX), which is why there is a worldwide uranium rush.

To produce the 25 tonnes or so of uranium fuel needed to keep your average reactor going for a year entails the extraction of half a million tonnes of waste rock and over 100,000 tonnes of mill tailings. These are toxic for hundreds of thousands of years. The conversion plant will generate another 144 tonnes of solid waste and 1343 cubic metres of liquid waste.

Contamination of local water supplies around uranium mines and processing plants has been documented in Brazil, Colorado, Texas, Australia, Namibia and many other sites. To supply even a fraction of the power stations the industry expects to be online worldwide in 2020 would mean generating 50 million tonnes of toxic radioactive residues every single year.

These tailings contain uranium, thorium, radium, polonium, and emit radon-222. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency sets limits of emissions from the dumps and monitors them. This does not happen in many less developed areas.

The long-term management cost of these dumps is left out of the current market prices for nuclear fuel and may be as high as the uranium cost itself. The situation for the depleted uranium waste arising during enrichment even may be worse, says the World Information Service on Energy.

No one can convince me that the above process is carbon-free, as politicians claim. It takes a lot of – almost certainly fossil-fuelled – energy to move that amount of rock and process the ore. But the carbon cost is often not in the country where the fuel is consumed.",0,,,5,science

The comment mentioned that GMO can still be bad because marginalizing farmers financially by restricting GMO seed use is wrong. 

However, restricting seed use is generally for a good reason. For example, when farmers are using midge tolerant wheat seed, they need to ensure they’re getting the proper ratio of tolerant seed vs. susceptible seed so that wheat midge does not then develop a resistance to the genetics of the wheat seed. 

Midge tolerant wheat seed is, I believe, 90% tolerant and 10% susceptible. So midge can still feed off of some of the plants. Farmers buy the seed and plant it with the peace of mind that their wheat isn’t going to suffer mass yield loss from midge. Farmers are then restricted to using farm-saved seed only one generation past certified, because otherwise you’re risking skewing the varietal blend. 

This ensures that the midge-tolerance genetics don’t break down.",0,,,82,science

However, weighting pesticides by the EIQ lowers the difference in herbicide use by GT soybean adopters (such that the estimated average impact over the study period is statistically indistinguishable from zero). Adoption of Bt maize, on the other hand, is associated with a clearer decline in insecticide use. This is broadly consistent with previous work (11–13, 17), although we find a smaller reduction""

Herbicide use has gone ""up"" though, but that's complicated. The problem there is switching between different types of pesticide. Glyphosate basically replaced older herbicides. You need less of it per acre, and it's much safer than the older herbicides (extremely low oral toxicity, inhalation hazards, cancer risk, etc.). So while herbicide use has gone up, health risk goes down. It also allowed more no-tillage methods, so it's saving on soil depletion and carbon emissions too.

The only special thing about GMOs is that they can contain genes that are not variations on genes from the parent organism. This inclusion of novel genes is not a requirement, and is very useful.

It is entirely correct to say that humans have been genetically modifying foods for thousands of years, because we have been doing that through hybridization and artificial selection. We have been using those methods to change the genetics of the crops, even if we didn't know it.",0,,,17,science

Sure. Unless you want to use terms the way they're actually defined, in which case a 'genetic modification' and 'selective breeding' are distinct mechanisms. Regardless of whether they have the end result or not. 

You can be as loose with your terminology as you like, but don't call it correct. 

>There are conventional and even organic methods that use mutagens (radiation or chemicals) and then follow that up with selective breeding.

....and? That doesn't make the two techniques interchangeable. It means you've used both, and have done selective breeding on a genetically modified organism. Radiation and mutagens are a shotgun, CRISPR is a scalpel, but all three are genetic modification. 

If you want to start calling selection 'genetic modification' then every living organism has been genetically modified by it's environment and the term has no longer has any meaning.",0,,,7,science
byo8pu,5,"So, when people (including myself) say that these are cases of genetic modification, we mean that this is a mechanism that has changed the genes. This is rhetorical, sure, but the point is that there is an effect on the genes. 

""Genetic Modification"" is not a distinct mechanism, it is an effect. The term shows up in legal documents as defining GMOs in a particular way because of advertising and politics, not because of biology.

For example: You cannot have something be organic and GMO, according to legislation in, at least, Canada and the US. You say:

> Radiation and mutagens are a shotgun, CRISPR is a scalpel, they are all genetic modification. 

And yet, the techniques using radiation and mutagens *can be organic*. Genetic modification is talking about changing genes. In your sentence, you effectively agree with me that genetic modification is about changing genes, not just about modern molecular biological techniques, the products of which we label GMOs. I just want to be clear, we do not label radiation and mutagen products as GMOs, despite them being genetic modifications. Selective breeding controls the genetics of the organisms. If you think this is not genetic modification, then fine, but your line here is unnecessarily pedantic and not representative of what is going on. Hybridization is a techniques used throughout history that literally introduces genes from another organism, often other species and genera, that would not have been present in the parent. This is  very analogous to most GMOs, only less specific.

When I say that we have been genetically modifying things for thousands of years, of course it is not to the precision of CRISPR, and there are capabilities which are impossible without modern molecular biology, but many of the changes we make could have coincidentally been made, and selected for, using historical techniques.

The purpose of the argument is to try and demystify genetic modification via molecular biological techniques (what we call, in legislation and colloquially, GMOs).

>""Genetic Modification"" is not a distinct mechanism, it is an effect.

No, it's not. Genetic modification is the action, not the result. The result of genetic modification is a genetically modified organism. And now you're going in circles trying to separate the two. You're not demystifying anything, you're muddying the water on something that should be perfectly clear. If a person is talking about 'GMOs' and another person says 'Bro literally everything we eat is a GMO because selection' that person is wrong. Selection is also a mechanism, and the effect of selection is...literally every living organism in existence. Because selection pressure is inherent to anything that can change and reproduce.

The free range requirements of all of the relevant certifications for broilers that I am aware of (GAP, Certified organic, and Canada's Animal Care Program) are more about the optics of providing fresh air to the bird than they are about fulfilling a need for the bird. There is some research out of Europe that shows that birds that spend more time outside have higher stress levels than those that did not (though the research did not use the best model). The main need that outdoor access is satisfying is the need to forage which can also be met by just providing access to a material that the birds can forage through successfully (hay is a common substrate). Most free range barns just have a pasture attached to the barn that the birds can enter should they please, which they do not. A bare field exposés the bird to prédation which they generally find unpleasant. I did read a paper once that showed that but providing shelters to the bird they can increase utilization and decrease stress, however these shelters also attract wild birds which expose the chicken to disease (including the ever frightening avian influenza).

For instance, if these plants are modified to produce even small concentrations of noxious substances that are immediately harmful to insects but only harmful to humans with chronic recurrent exposure.

So I planned on just posting the above question but figured I could look into it myself. The genetically modified variety of maize referred to in the linked study is known as MON 810.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MON_810

MON 810 is a strain of maize that has a gene inserted into its genome that is taken from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, and this gene codes for Bt toxin, which is lethally poisonous to certain insects.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis

From the above wiki: “Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies) and against nematodes.[23][24] Thus, B. thuringiensis serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant genetically modified crops. When insects ingest toxin crystals, their alkaline digestive tracts denature the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus amenable to being cut with proteases found in the insect gut, which liberate the toxin from the crystal.[20] The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore.[25] The insect stops eating and starves to death”

Now in full disclosure, I’m a medical doctor (MD) and the fact that these toxins have known toxicity to insect digestive tracts makes me wonder whether the potential toxic effects of this particular protein have been studied at all in humans. Unfortunately, this is where things get messy.

A quick google search for “bt toxin human toxicity” finds a wide range of results ranging from the Entomological Society of America giving it’s stamp of approval to editorial articles suggesting that the toxin has not been thoroughly evaluated for human consumption and basic science evidence that the toxins may have negative immunogenic effects and kidney toxicity.

In an era where immunologic disease and chronic gastrointestinal illness (of particular note is the guts link to both immunity and mental health), this is extremely concerning to me. While the posted article certainly seems like a victory from a purely economic standpoint, as a healthcare professional, I think that this is an example of financial pressures pushing technology that is not proven safe and may be causing us more long term harm than good.

* Most sources seem to suggest you need an alkaline gut to dissolve the Bt toxins. The human gut is not alkaline. Exposure is minimal.

* Bt toxin seems to have been tested on a variety of non-insects. No particular toxic effects found. The most recent meta-study I found included 21 studies on vertebrates, some with doses thousands of times higher than environmental and exposure times of over several years, and no effects found (they also included specific tests for immunological perturbation, seeing as you mentioned it specifically). There may be more significant effects on some non-insects, such as spiders/mites/nematodes.

* Bt GMO crops showed no particular effects. Isolated Bt toxins showed no effects. However, some Bt based pesticides did have immunological effects on vertebrates, attributed to the remnants of the Bt itself, and associated proteins.

This is a common fear. There are many sources of information and many opinions, some more fact-based than others, on this. The NAS put out a research report (their reports are a gold standard for science policy) on GMO crop safety and efficacy a few years ago, which concluded overwhelmingly that GMO crops currently available for consumption are safe. The report was led by someone who historically was skeptical of the utility of GMO crops: http://nas-sites.org/ge-crops/category/report/.

>Now in full disclosure, I’m a medical doctor (MD) and the fact that these toxins have known toxicity to insect digestive tracts makes me wonder whether the potential toxic effects of this particular protein have been studied at all in humans.

As above, yes, they have. First of all, it's important to know that Bt was used for insecticides for decades before it was engineered into plants. From the same wiki page you posted: 

>Spores and crystalline insecticidal proteins produced by B. thuringiensis have been used to control insect pests since the 1920s and are often applied as liquid sprays.[34] They are now used as specific insecticides under trade names such as DiPel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators, and most other beneficial insects, and are used in organic farming;[24] however, the manuals for these products do contain many environmental and human health warnings,[35][36] and a 2012 European regulatory peer review of five approved strains found, while data exist to support some claims of low toxicity to humans and the environment, the data are insufficient to justify many of these claims.[37]

So to summarize, Bt and the organisms that produce it are found naturally occurring in the soil, have been (and still is sprayed) on organic crops, have been found in many studies to have no harmful short-term or long-term effects on human health, and are effective at controlling pests if managed responsibly and with an understanding of evolution and agriculture.

Finally, in an era where gut health is an issue and the microbiota of our guts is coming into consideration, what we know from centuries of nutritional science and more recent insights from other fields is that access to affordable, abundant fresh fruits and vegetables is both healthy and environmentally conscious. When people spread poorly thought out and poorly supported fear of GM or non-organic crops, they create yet another barrier to eating a vegetable-heavy diet where many barriers already exist, particularly for people with lower incomes or living in food deserts.

byo8pu,0,"Whenever I see posts about this I think of my friend karrissa who was an agricultural sciences major. She told me a story about being at a family wedding and her aunt asked her what she thought of gmo crops, she stated more or less 'that they are amazing and that people freak out even though basically everything we eat is technically speaking a gmo, maybe not as we think of it, but most plants have been genetically modified through selective breeding and such'


Her aunt proceeded to tell this incredibly intelligent and college educated girl that she was wrong and then cited different Facebook articles she saw about it. Karrissa slammed her drink back, told her (exact words) ""well I hope you starve to death cause everything we have in the world now has been modified someway and Facebook is dumb, bye Aunt Barb.""",0,,,11,science

Good so far.

Companies already can patent crops, including organic and non-GMO conventional crops.

What does this have to do with biodiversity?

Where is it illegal?

They buy from a company because it's more profitable to do so.",0,,,59,science
byo8pu,2,"GMOs are neither good nor bad. How can they be?

A saw is a tool, just as GMOs are a tool.

The social benefits of having access to the invention of the saw are self-evident.

But being wary of the risks when using a saw is not being ""anti-saw"". It's just being realistic about both risk and benefit at the same time. 

We use guards and other safety controls with saws, just as we should have safeguards for GMOs.

Saws are risky because they yeild great power in a concentrated place. Their benefit is also a risk. Nothing to be scared of, but know the risks and control them. 

GMOs create very great financial power increases in a narrow biological speciality. That power creates a risk, no matter how small. 

Nothing to be scared of, but know the risks and control them.",0,,,6,science

It might not be specifically related to GMO, but as more and more farmers would have to rely on this technology, they might not have any other choice. We shouldn't allow companies to control seed.",0,,,9,science
byo8pu,3,"A lot of the seeds in the market are patented no matter if they are GMO or ""regular"" hybrid seeds (non-GMO, but bred to be better than regular). And usually professional farmers don't use last years crop as seeds for next, but they buy the seeds. That's because the offspring produced by the hybrid plants doesn't necessarily carry all the good genes of the parents thus making it more of a gamble to plant those versus buying fresh seed, which is also guaranteed to be free of diseases or pathogens.",0,,,35,science

byo8pu,3,"This is not an option. 

If a farmer want a consistent crop (i.e. if you want to sell crops at all), then you need consistent seeds, with very similar genetics. Regardless or source or process, modern farming requires intellectual property rights for the R&D and operations required for making those seeds.

It's not even good business to store your own seeds. Specialization in farming makes the whole system more efficient, which is better for everyone.

If you believe otherwise, please tell me who you would like to starve to death.",0,,,15,science

So just use the non-GMO alternative. Nobody is forcing you to use new designer seeds.",0,,,5,science
byo8pu,1,"No one has ever forced anyone to buy gmo seeds. Farmers decide to do so because it makes them more profitable. No one ever forced anyone to modify genes so that our food supply skyrocketed to feed a growing planet. People did so because it was profitable. Had it not been profitable it might never have been done. If farmers would like to use traditional seeds and grow less food and make less money and pollute more and use more insecticide, they are free to do so.
