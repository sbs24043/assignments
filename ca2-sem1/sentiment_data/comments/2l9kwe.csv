2l9kwe,1,"In particular, air pollution (soot and ground level ozone) is short lived and immediate benefits can be seen as soon as action is taken (reduce or eliminate source).  This is not true for CO2 or methane in the atmosphere.

Also, this is looking at the last 30 years. Climate change from our CO2 output over the past 100 years is having an effect, but the models show greater and greater effect in the years to come. Likewise any action taken will take decades to see an corresponding decrease in its effects.

This is also speaks nothing concerning tipping points.",0,,,14,science

2l9kwe,0,"I'm curious on if they are talking about potential yield here as opposed to actual yield. Actual yield per hectare has gone up at least since the 94/95 season in India from 2.4 metric tonnes per hectare to 3.1 metric tonnes per hectare for the last 2 seasons. The 94/95 season is the earliest I can find on the FAS site and I don't have time to look for another reference showing data into the '80s.

2l9kwe,2,"I just read the abstract now that I'm at home (for some reason, I couldn't get it to open at work). You are correct. The abstract reads ""... Our statistical model suggests that, averaged over India, yields in 2010 were up to 36% lower for wheat than they otherwise would have been, absent climate and pollutant emissions trends, ...""

I've been trying to tell people for years that the conversation of emmission caps and alternative fuels should be shifted away from climate change and brought to spotlight the ridiculously harmful and immediate effects of pollution. No republican can argue against that.",0,,,6,science

2l9kwe,0,"That second sentence really doesn't prove the first. The study is good, but you're reading more into it than you should have.

Air pollution is more of a localised, immediate problem. Emphasis on 'more of', when compared to what is probably the most global and long term problem humanity has ever faced.

Air pollution emitted in India today reduces crop yields in India tomorrow.

Climate changed caused by India today will reduce global crop yields many years down the track.",0,,,2,science
2l9kwe,0,"As a farmer in the US this is my experience so far with human emissions (not to say that the consequences won't be different in the future).  Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have allowed higher yields relative to available water (though I have read the resulting product has less nutrition, but I don't know).  Ultra low sulfur fuels and more stringent emissions standards at power plants means I now have to add sulfur to my fields as fertilizer for top yields when I didn't have to before. ",0,,,2,science
