Are profits harder? Yes.

Is most permaculture garbage? Yes.",0,,,30,farming
jbze83,1,">Is most permaculture garbage? Yes.

Permaculturists: *Permaculture is circular, we return as much of the product to the field as we can ensuring we export as little nutrient as possible.

Also permaculturists: *First thing we're going to do is import this metric cunt-ton of material*",0,,,19,farming
jbze83,2,Well I’m adding metric cunt-ton to my everyday vocabulary. Thanks for that,0,,,4,farming
jbze83,2,Don't suppose you'd mind doing an explain like I'm five about that would you? I'd love to hear  exactly what the farming community thinks about permaculture...,0,,,1,farming

jbze83,4,">Feeding the world with permaculture is a naive dream of people who simply have no clue what they are talking about. 

Too right. I don't have the source to hand, but I read a study of a permaculture ""farm"" and from the income generated, the hourly wage for a worker was something like €3!",0,,,6,farming
jbze83,4,"Your argument is that permaculture doesn’t work at scale, and I agree. Isn’t that they point though? Large farms are part of the problem, because they require what you mention to operate. 

However, just “breaking up big ag” is a much bigger topic. We’d actually need a country where more than 1.5% of the population wants to work on farms. We’d then need better transportation systems to bring that product to market economically.

We can feed the world with regenerative agriculture, but we need a huge macroeconomic shift to do that.",0,,,2,farming
jbze83,5,"Maybe if the world returned to a primarily agrarian economy.  But likely not even then unless there is a concurrent massive population decline.  Regardless, it isn't worth considering because it can not and will not happen in any way we can plan for.  Maybe a James bond villain could cause it to be pulled off.

Large farms are not a problem, unless there is a political ideology that makes them a problem.  They are a solution to people leaving rural areas",0,,,10,farming
jbze83,5,"No, the point is that 4000 farms of 1 acre cannot hope to produce what 1 farm of 4000 acres can. To even come close the labor input would be massive. Crop loss would be much higher %. The price of food would skyrocket. So, you need more land which means you cut down more forest. My state is a clear indication of what it takes to survive, in the late 1800’s over 70% was deforested, now it is the opposite. 95% of the population thinks food is from a grocery store. 

Maybe if there was a massive population decline on the order of 75% and we returned to a pre-industrial revolution society it would be possible to “do away with big ag”. However neither of these things is likely and to feed an ever increasing and urban population that literally has no means or desire to feed itself we need big ag, as you call it, to keep growing wheat at 65 bu. an acre.",0,,,10,farming

jbze83,0,"Yields in the U.S. have steadily been increasing for the last 100+ years. I have heard there are certain regions around the globe where land degradation has caused stagnating to declining yields. IMO, poor land management/conservation and failure to keep up with Ag industry technology. 

However, where land management is adequate with ever better technology/science yields have and will continue to rise most places around the globe. I think the only threat to a consistent decline in yields would be climate change which we know will happen to some degree but it's quite unknown how much the climate will change and where those changes will occur or impact the most.",0,,,18,farming
jbze83,0,"Yields are on a clear upward trend. Monocultures have a higher risk of catastrophic failure, but yields are high enough to generally make up for it. I firmly believe that we should have more crop rotations and pasture, to insure against failure, but the closest we have to widespread failure so far is probably the widespread flooding across the great plains a year and a half ago, but we still have enough corn and soybeans. 

On a macro level an environmental event is much less likely to destroy a very large farm than a small one, but it doesn't damage the national or global supply chain as much if one or two small farms disappear.",0,,,13,farming
jbze83,0,"Yields are either consistent or increasing. 
I hear from many non-farming groups that want to act as if agriculture is getting worse and that it was better 30 or 50 or 500 years ago. To me it’s very much the equivalent of an elder person saying “Back in my day...” and then tell a nostalgic story about how one small aspect was different, but really not better.",0,,,7,farming
jbze83,1,"My grand father raised 20 bushel an acre beans on dry land.  My father raised 50 bushel an acre beans on leveled & irrigated land.  Today we're pushing 80 bushels an acre, but we're also spending more on soil tests, plant tissue analysis, micro-nutrients plus a spray rig that can deliver them.",0,,,2,farming
jbze83,0,"Mostly garbage, it is harder to turn a profit but that's because, mostly production is up and stable. When there is consistent supply prices remain relatively low. And when there are dips in demand like when China stops buying beans, prices drop further on all related commodities. That's pretty broad generalizations, but my .02.",0,,,10,farming
jbze83,0,Yields are going up in Australia. ( it’s not quite this simple but gives u an idea) Harder to make profit because we are price takers not price makers. We take the price the buyer decides. If ours is too high they just buy from anouther country.,0,,,2,farming
jbze83,0,I think it's much more complex that yes or no.... Especially with the example given. agriculture is a headache x5 for me. But I love it and this comment is probably useless,0,,,2,farming
jbze83,0,"Here’s a paper on the soil side of things. Fertilizer in the Midwest, specifically has and is being mismanaged. Anyone saying “yields are just going up, so everything is fine” is incredibly ignorant. Most producers understand the importance of their soil, but unfortunately some of the early “research” was funded by the fertilizer industry.
