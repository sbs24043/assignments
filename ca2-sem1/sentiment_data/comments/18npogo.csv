18npogo,0,"Geomagnetic storms, cyber attacks, physical attacks; there's quite a few ways the grid could go offline.

People have no idea how horrific a world without power would be, at least until stabilized. Estimates range up to 90% dead within a year if the grid stays offline (casualties within the U.S.)",0,,,29,science
18npogo,0,Almost anything “could” happen,0,,,29,science
18npogo,1,"Geomagnetic storms of the size that could cause something like that happen every few hundred years. Last one that might have caused something like the findings described here is the Carrington Event in 1859. Though, it was less of a problem then, because they did not have as much tech as we do now.",0,,,22,science
18npogo,1,"not anything can happen at any time. The things that could take place at this very moment make up what's been called ""the adjacent possible"". In this case, fuel depletion and solar storms are incidents that could take place. And, if they did, we would be pretty much ducked up in the hundreds of millions or billions of people.

There must be people somewhere who study these things, risk assessment or prevention, etc. There was a guy hired for this purpose in my school and he shared with us his analysis of each thing that could go awry at a moment's notice: ""see this heavy mountain hill near our classrooms? it could fall down if it rained too much, and fall over us."" We even did terrorist drill, in a French colony overseas in Africa. Luckily, I was always away when those took place.

I have no formal training, I've recently read about this concept on a book. Here's a yet-to-be-watched video on the topic:

18npogo,1,Isn't there a growing shortage of phosphites or whatever phosphorus derivative that will contribute to a future crop yield drop?,0,,,5,science
18npogo,2,"what's sad and funny is that this was so expected that it's a running reference point in ""A Brave New World""",0,,,7,science
18npogo,3,"This is not strange at all though because Brave New World was intentionally looking at futuristic technologies and how technology would change the world. Another interesting topic in the book is the ratio of magnesium to iron in the human diet which was one of the keys to enhancing lifespan and this topic is still being actively researched. This is basic science though, magnesium and iron are the core molecules of chlorophyll and hemoglobin respectively so it's obvious that they are crucial building blocks of life. The same is true for phosphorous and the truth is that there is no shortage of phospohorous either. It is easily mined with saturation mining which makes it low cost to extract from ores. All of the elements on this planet are constantly being recycled both intentionally by humanity and unintentionally by natural forces of erosion and plate tectonics as well as non-human biological forces among others.",0,,,2,science
18npogo,2,"Last I heard they'd either found more, found new ways to obtain it or redid the numbers, because apparently now we're not expecting to break peak phosphorus until the 2030s.",0,,,2,science
18npogo,3,20...30s? Bruv that's not that far from now,0,,,5,science
18npogo,4,"When I first heard of the concept, the estimate was around 2010, so we're doing ok, I guess?",0,,,1,science
18npogo,4,Time to find more or develop a replacement. People are hopefully working on this.,0,,,1,science
18npogo,0,Isn’t the current monocrop farming model unsustainable as is?,0,,,4,science
18npogo,0,"My family and I run a vegetable farm and can't pay the bills as it stands. What are we supposed to do?

We pay our people more than we pay ourselves, which still isn't comparable to white collar pay, but if we had to replace all our machines with people we could never do even that. Are we to choose between paying people a living wage and having machinery? Don't we also want to maximize the food we get per acre also?

Also without fertilizer the alternative is slash and burn (as in destroying the rainforest because you've used up all the nutrients in the soil) which I thought was worse? And not really an option most places anyway?",0,,,7,science
18npogo,1,The US hasn't paid a true price for food in a long time. I've been watching for a few decades as industrial ag makes the situation worse--it seems clear they aren't interested in sustainable practices because those cut into profits.,0,,,7,science
18npogo,2,Indeed. Every government program and technology that comes out makes the big guys (6 or 7 digits acres of land) richer but anyone smaller than that (we've got about 80 acres) struggles to compete. I wish people knew how much work goes into everything we grow. Whenever someone complains about the price of a tomato it hurts and I don't know what to do.,0,,,5,science
18npogo,3,"People could stand to be more knowledgeable about where their food comes from. If the grid fails, they'll find out!",0,,,2,science
18npogo,1,"Seems like you need to get better at farming.

Get good or get off the land and let someone productive actually use it.",0,,,-13,science
18npogo,2,You have literally no clue about farming. Farming is probably the single lowest profit margin industry in the world. What they describe is pretty par for the course,0,,,10,science
18npogo,3,"Yeah, nah.

There are two kinds of farmers: those who can run a farm business and make bank and those who can't and cry about it.

The problem with those who can't is summed up very well in the opinion you'll find those who can have of them:

Farm land is a very valuable, important and limited resource wasted on those who can't farm. If you can't run a profitable farm, get off the land and let some who can do so.

As for profitability and margins: the average margin is 11% in the US, and the top quartile of farms regularly see profits of over 20%.

Farmers are not poor. Haven't been for centuries.",0,,,-7,science
18npogo,4,There's a big difference between ag corps and family farms. The latter doesn't have much ability to compete anymore.,0,,,3,science
18npogo,5,"So? If they can't compete they're wasting land.

They can either stop crying or get of it.

Do you know how an ag corp actually functions?  
They hire and train farmers who can farm to run farms.",0,,,0,science
18npogo,6,"Don't cut yourself on that edge, kid!",0,,,2,science
18npogo,1,Yeah other than getting some cattle and doubling your land and going back to good ole fashioned way of fertilizing. You’re fucked. But we’re fucked with you.,0,,,1,science
18npogo,2,Doubling land and getting cattle would be great if we weren't surrounded on all sides by housing developments and highways so yeah,0,,,3,science
18npogo,1,"Grazing animals are still a decent way to do this. Rabbits, geese, cows. You can either pen them tightly on the area you want treated, then move them on and let the area rest, or you can collect droppings and compost from wherever they're kept. More repeatable than just burning the place.",0,,,1,science
18npogo,2,"A couple farms near us tried that and lost everything. The few farms left in my area are surrounded by housing developments and the municipalities took the neighbors' sides on the smell. We don't want to go down the same way, and don't have enough help to care for animals on top of the crops anyway.",0,,,2,science
18npogo,3,"That's competing with people still using chemical fertilizer though, right? If it was a matter of shortage, the economics could change a lot.",0,,,1,science
18npogo,4,I think every other farm could fail and our township still wouldn't let us have animals,0,,,2,science
18npogo,0,Aw gee. It's almost as if we should be responsible for our own personal/community's food production(security) to a certain degree instead of sitting on our asses scoffing down refined wheat and sugar while absorbing the latest batch of digital drivel.,0,,,5,science
18npogo,0,"Another good reason to go vegan

>Producing 1 kg of boneless meat requires an average of 2.8 kg human-edible feed in ruminant systems and 3.2 kg in monogastric systems

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912416300013

>There is also a highly unequal distribution of land use between livestock and crops for human consumption. If we combine pastures used for grazing with land used to grow crops for animal feed, livestock accounts for 77% of global farming land. While livestock takes up most of the world’s agricultural land it only produces 18% of the world’s calories and 37% of total protein.3

https://ourworldindata.org/land-use",0,,,-1,science
18npogo,1,I'm not against veganism but I fail to see your logic. I run a vegetable farm with my family (no animals at all) and we would be completely fucked without electricity all the same.,0,,,14,science
18npogo,2,"Yeah according to the article your yield would fall 35-48%

But if we had two times as many farms like yours, due to moving farmland away from animal agriculture, that would not result in mass starvation",0,,,4,science
18npogo,3,"Really, these arguments could be construed to support non-veganism.  If we routinely produce 2X the food we need then veganism is our backup plan in case a severe world food shortage occurs.

Its like having a fast car where the extra power might save you once in a lifetime.",0,,,2,science
18npogo,0,Is this sub called Fear Factor now?,0,,,0,science
18npogo,0,"I’ve never been a dooms day type. I have an earthquake kit that would get me and my wife through about 4 days.  but after watching “Leave the World Behind”  I decided it might be a good idea to get a generator, some back up fuel and learn to can some Food.  Not that the movie scared me per se but it got me thinking, I big quake in my area could knock us off the grid for up to three weeks. 4 days isn’t enough.",0,,,1,science
18npogo,0,Weird most of the big fertilizer plants I know can generate their own power so they wouldn't be affected as much by grid disruptions tbh. If the storms were strong enough to affect fertilizer production I think there are going to be bigger problems that people will be worrying about.,0,,,1,science
18npogo,0,"Don't worry, we'll just go back to using sewage...",0,,,1,science
