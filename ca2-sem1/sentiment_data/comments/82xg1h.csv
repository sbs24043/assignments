You have to consider the plants and populations short and long term adaption to these differences, they are more resilient that you would thing. Obviously it's not good, but it probably over estimates.",0,,,9,science

Those are more realistic scenarios if China continues to ruin the earth and if predictive models are exactly right. ",0,,,4,science

I'm in one of the ""safest states"" in the U.S. for climate change and so far this year we've experienced both record lows and record highs. What do you think that does to evolution in the long run? Only the strongest will survive.",0,,,0,science

I did and I'm fully aware of who I was attributing it towards. 

>I'm in one of the ""safest states"" in the U.S for climate change.

That makes zero sense as climate change and safety isn't regional. Also, you guys deal with massive forest fires, mudslides, drought to add on to the earthquakes, and violent crime rates. You really have no idea what you're talking about this but I will say, it is hilarious.

As for actual safety, it's #19 safest and even less so if you factor San Fran, LA etc.

Also, it's [#32 overall](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings) and the [poorest State](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-jackson-california-poverty-20180114-story.html). It's a joke. My GF who lived in the state and the two years I spent when stationed at LAAFB, it was at one time a good state. It's been in a sharp downward spiral since '92.

>so far this year we've experienced both record lows and record high

Not quite. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_temperature_extremes

>What do you think that does to evolution in the long run?

Do you even know what evolution is? You're thinking of adaptation. What does it do? It causes us to adapt like any of us do with extreme circumstances. However, climate change is a much more gradual change.

>Only the strongest will survive.

Some species will go extinct over the next 100 years because of it considering that 99.998% of every species on Earth has gone extinct at one point. Humans will obviously be fine but those in more impoverished countries or have huge population density issues will have problems but humanity itself will be fine if the worst case scenario occurred which models are suggesting it wont.

82xg1h,0,"Sounds like a crisitunity to me. As mean temperatures increase too high in California, they will increase to the optimal range in more northern states like Oregon and Washington.

82xg1h,1,"This isn't entirely correct. Most commercially grown avocados are grafted from a small handful of parent trees. There is very little genetic diversity in Californian avocados, so they won't adapt easily.
