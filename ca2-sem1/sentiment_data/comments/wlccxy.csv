wlccxy,4,"I'm not who you're asking, but I thought this recent interview with the Agriculture Minister by an ag news source was pretty interesting: https://www.realagriculture.com/2022/08/no-intention-of-going-in-a-regulatory-direction-says-minister-bibeau-regarding-fertilizer-emissions-target/

>Kelvin Heppner: I’m sure you’ve been following the discussion and the reaction to the federal target. It was announced back in 2020, but it’s been in the spotlight lately. Can you bring us up to speed on what the government’s plan is, at this point, when it comes to reducing emissions from nitrogen fertilizer, as there is plenty of concern that this will mean reduced fertilizer use?

>Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau: No, absolutely not. We are really talking about reducing our emissions generally. And we have identified that emissions caused by fertilizer are significant. So we have to pay special attention, and we have to invest with the industry to find ways to reduce the emissions. So once again, it’s not reducing fertilizer, it’s reducing the emissions caused by. This is why we are investing in different ways. The On-Farm Climate Action Program, for example, it’s a way to provide farmers with incentives to de-risk the adoption of good practices like the 4R example. We are investing in the Living Labs, adding our scientists in the field, all across the country, to be able to develop good practices that fit the reality of the different regions of our big country. So it’s really in this direction that we’re going. It’s a voluntary target. It’s an ambitious target, of course, because we have to move the needle. But really, our hope is to get as many farmers and the stakeholders of the industry that produce our fertilizer, moving in the right direction to reduce the emissions. And actually, we can see already that grain farmers and the dairy farmers, for example, having a net-zero emission objective by 2050. So we see the industry going in this direction already.

> ... KH: So for farmers listening to (or reading) this minister, what should they be expecting down the road? Should they expect restrictions or banning of certain practices or fertilizer timing or products? Will they have to use enhanced efficiency fertilizer products and put them in the field in a certain way? What does it look like at the farm level come 2030?

>Bibeau: I would say stay tuned on the best practices, and the better inputs. We have no intention of going in a regulatory direction. This is once again a voluntary target but we need the everyone to join forces. We want to make sure that our soil will stay healthy, that our agriculture will be sustainable, environmentally, of course, but also financially. And I would also say, in the human perspective, it’s important that we support our farmers as well. So it’s really stay tuned, stay connected with with your association, with the industry. Just get this information on what the best practices are, and move forward in this direction to contribute to the transition toward a low emission agriculture.",0,,,14,moderatepolitics
wlccxy,5,"Thanks, this was great and answered a lot of my questions.

There aren’t any real articles about it, because nothing has actually been done.

There aren’t much details about it yet because there isn’t an official “plan” but what I can tell you is that any initiative will be completely voluntary and there will be financial support in place to offset any negative impact from those who choose to take part.",0,,,17,moderatepolitics

wlccxy,3,"> reduce dependence on fertilizer if they can still maintain production levels

*What?*

How can you maintain production levels without fertilisers? That's completely impossible. Not on a lack of technology, but plants simply don't work that way. Plants *need* fertiliser to grow. It is like innovating so plants can reduce their dependence on water or that people reduce their dependence on vitamin D.",0,,,5,moderatepolitics
wlccxy,4,"I don’t think you understand.

The objective of the program is not to introduce regulations of any sort.

There will be no *mandating* farmers to reduce fertilizer use.

There will be no asking that farmers reduce fertilizer use.

The program is centered around asking farmers to *voluntarily* adopt farming practices that, once again, reduce the need for fertilizer. One example of this is using more efficient fertilizers that reduce emissions but maintain crop output.

> How can you maintain production levels without fertilisers? 

Nobody is asking farmers to eliminate the use of fertilizers, just merely to make their processes more efficient, which is the same logic and principles as a program to retrofit older houses to need less power, which is more efficient and saves costs and reduces emissions. Coincidentally, the Government of Canada has a *voluntary* program for retrofitting houses, and this very same program is built off the same principles as that one!",0,,,5,moderatepolitics
wlccxy,5,"So what is the point of it? Farmers reducing fertilisers will mean less yield, which means less profits. Farmers aren't there because they love putting seeds and harvesting, but to make a profit.

>just merely to make their processes more efficient,

Plants have specific nutrient requirements that are given through fertilisers. You either supply them and have plants grow well or not give them, growing smaller plants that require more arable area to have the same yield.

That's like saying instead of giving calcium so people can have strong bones, we must instead find ways to reduce calcium consumption and force the bones themselves to be more efficient with less calcium.",0,,,3,moderatepolitics
wlccxy,6,"> Farmers reducing fertilizers will mean less yield 

Farmers aren’t reducing fertilizers, they’re just using more efficient ones which reduce the overall usage of fertilizers.
