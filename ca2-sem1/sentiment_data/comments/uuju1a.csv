You're right, they definitely are the ones mostly responsible for all of this, but people in the west in general are the ones driving the consumerism which the corporations are working to meet the demand of. People buying new phones, TVs, cars etc. every single year, throwing away things that go to landfill which could instead be given away or recycled. 

I think governments should be stepping in at this stage and limiting all companies from releasing annual iterations of their goods, for example no new iPhone or Samsung Galaxy every single year - they're entitled to release a new model every 3-4 years and their old phones need to be as recyclable as possible. Same for TVs, iPads, smart watches, washing machines, driers, ovens, fridges etc. except I would extend the limit to 8-10 years for the large home appliances, and again these should be mandatory to be recycled. All of these manufacturers would be forced to start building their products to last then, and we would probably see bigger advances in the tech for each iteration, compared to nowadays where there's very little difference between releases each year. I don't think we can ever end consumerism, but we could and should definitely be making a change in how ridiculous it's gotten over the past decades",0,,,17,ireland

uuju1a,4,"Interesting hypothetical, are there many instances of appliances cutting their energy consumption in half in the space of a year? I'd still say yes, because individuals buying something like a washing machine, fridge, drier would go into their purchase with the expectation that it'll last a decade at least, and basically all appliances are already highly efficient as is. I've heard of people having fridges and things like ovens for 20+ years, but over the last couple of decades it seems like lots of appliances aren't built to last, and people can end up needing to replace them after only a few years. The idea here is to influence back that better engineering and try to reduce forced obscurity and encourage recycling of all electronics possible to reduce wastage and pollution",0,,,2,ireland
uuju1a,5,"I suppose that right to repair law will help with that. Some people at least will keep their current appliance a bit longer than they might otherwise.

Banning new models being released would just cause uproar if it happened now, from business and consumer alike. But I could see a path where it becomes more palatable to the consumer",0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,6,">Banning new models being released would just cause uproar if it happened now, from business and consumer alike

If they start with appliances like washing machines and fridges I doubt there'd be much uproar from consumers, like who would be outraged about there not being annual models of those things released. Then build the arguments for doing the same to other electronics once there's hard data about the environmental impact the changes had on washing machines and fridges. All of this would definitely require strong leaders who actually give enough of a shit to have the integrity to not be lobbied or pressured by the corporations, so that alone means this is probably all unrealistic anyway

Is the right to repair not for individuals to be able to repair their electronics using repairmen not associated with the manufacturers? For example, only Apple affiliates can repair Apple products from what I understand, whereas right to repair makes that type of thing illegal?

The majority of crops grown are for livestock. We grow enough food to feed the _80 billion_ land animals that we slaughter a year.

uuju1a,0,"Yeah it's not looking good, but overall I'm optimistic. 

When the Thwaites glacier finally goes, everything changes. Sea-level will steadily rise, every coastal city and town on earth will be affected and tides will be higher everywhere. It's too late to start building sea walls now, so that's the future we're looking at.

We all need to become, even a little bit, more self sufficient with our food supplies. How we handled covid in this country, especially at the beginning, makes me fairly confident that we'll stick together through this.

The wind farms and solar farms we're building will make us less reliant on supplies from the rest of the world. If we improve our health and education systems (we need to return some focus to practical skills), we'll be in a good position.

A slightly less optimistic point - we need to improve our defence forces too.",0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,Try not to be. Very little I can do about it. Tell me what I can do and I'll do it if I can. But it's hard to know what to believe on just about every topic these days.,0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,1,"Nobody wants to hear this but biggest thing any individual can do is to eat a plant based diet.

uuju1a,2,"Well as I said it's hard to know what to believe. That said there are plenty of other good reasons to go plant based. Failed miserably last time I tried but if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.",0,,,3,ireland
uuju1a,3,"One of the things that helped me is it doesn’t have to be perfect. At first I was only eating plant based at home, but when out with friends I’d consume meat etc as it was still massively reducing my consumption and helping the planet. I have since cut this out but for the first year or so it differently helps.
Another important thing is just because you’ve bought/eaten something that you didn’t realise has animal products in it, there is no need to beat yourself up about it and fall off the bandwagon just call it a mistake and move on.",0,,,2,ireland
uuju1a,0,No. We could do with a bit of warming!,0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,"There is a problem bad it definitely needs attention, but I'm not worried. Theyve been saying the same thing for decades not. I'm sure according to earlier models we're all supposed to be underwater by now.",0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,Yes I am. But sure what can you do. Corporations run the world.,0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,"It's concerning but I see little reason to worry about something that is completely outside of my control. Every generation has faced enormous challenges - plagues, pandemics, wars, famines, economic collapse, the threat of nuclear armaggeddon. There could be some very tough times ahead, but what else is new? And at least Ireland is in a favourable geographic location compared to most places. 

As for the matter of having a child with your gf - do it if you both want one and don't obsess too much over an unknown future, because the future is ALWAYS unknown and unpredictable.",0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,"kind of, but climate change is something only we can solve, the idea of not having children over climate change is very defeatist in my view. as opposed to creating more people who can help solve the crisis, its basically surrendering to the idea the world will end anyway",0,,,1,ireland
uuju1a,0,"No, we went from 990 million to 8 billion in 200 years. No amount of washing my plastic containers out is going to reverse that.",0,,,1,ireland

This is a great illustration of how grave things are:
