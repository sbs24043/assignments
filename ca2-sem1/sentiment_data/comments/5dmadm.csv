5dmadm,0,"Paragraphs of waffle and then we get to the 'glitch':

> To protect themselves from direct sunlight’s damaging effects, they use a mechanism called nonphotochemical quenching, which allows the plant to release some of that absorbed energy as heat — like a pressure-relief valve in a steam engine, Niyogi said.

I have never heard of 'nonphotochemical quenching', but I assume that it's what everyone else calls ""[photorespiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration#/media/File:Simplified_photorespiration_diagram.jpg)"". The most plentiful enzyme on the planet, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase or RuBisCO to its friends has difficulty distinguishing between oxygen and carbon dioxide. The oxidation reaction - aka photorespiration - leads to toxic peroxide and ammonia buildups and is generally undesirable, but is a weakness of RuBisCO that becomes pronounced at high temperatures and low CO2 availability in the leaf: in bright sunlight when photosynthesis is banging along. 

An alternative scheme has evolved many times amongst plants, the C4 pathway. This  uses PEC-C (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) to carbon dioxide, concentrates the resulting chemical (malate) twenty-fold in low oxygen structures before exposing it to RuBisCO. This in effect increases carbon dioxide concentration by 40 fold and reduces oxygen levels, thus turning off photorespiration. The result is markedly more effective carbon fixation.

Why hasn't C4 conquered the world? Well, it pretty much has conquered the tropics, where over 8000 species use it. A further bunch of dryland plants such as cacti use CAM, which handles carbon fixation (to malate) in the dark and then, stomata shut and water loss minimised, carry out the photosynthesis reaction in the day. Some plants - tomatoes, for example, can do both C3 and C4, so there must be advantages to C3 in low light,m low temperature environments.   
",0,,,39,science
5dmadm,1,"Nope. Non photochemical quenching isn't the same thing as photorespiration at all. Two very different processes. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photochemical_quenching

I'm  no C4 expert, but I think you're right on the limits of C4 photosynthesis! Temperature is a huge factor, and a big reason that you don't see as many high latitude C4 plants!",0,,,32,science
5dmadm,2,"> Temperature is a huge factor, and a big reason that you don't see as many high latitude C4 plants!

And the few that you do see, like zoysia grass, tend to go dormant as soon as temps start to drop. My grandmother had a zoysia grass lawn and while it looked great in the summer months, it was brown from oct-april every year.",0,,,6,science
5dmadm,3,This is exactly why they reseed lawns in fall/spring. They're switching from a C3 grass to a C4 grass.,0,,,2,science
5dmadm,1,"Non photochemical quenching is the thermal decay of the of a photoexcited electron into a lower energy state. The electron is in a high energy state from absorbing a high energy photon (in the case of plants this roughly corresponds to the visible region) if too many of these exited electrons exist in the chloroplast their electrical potential will begin to break down the biochemical structures surrounding them (like a car engine held at high revs for too long). to limit the revs the electron can either drop straight down to its ground (either passing the energy onto another dye molecule or by emitting a photon of similar energy to the one originally absorbed). Alternatively it can drop down to its ground state by a more circuitous route, releasing a little bit of energy at a time (heat). The best analogy would be taking the stairs from the 2nd to the 1st floor rather than jumping out the window. ",0,,,7,science
5dmadm,2,"I once build a UV absorbance system with which to monitor the decay of NADPH+ to NADP, the exponential decay constant defining the rate at which energy was being captured before the onset of the sudden darkness cast by the instrument. Too much reduced NADP dies indeed have dangerous implications for the thylacoid, and mechanisms are needed to dump it, usually via peroxides int he peroxisome. Quite how preventing such dumping helps anything isn't (to me) clear. ",0,,,2,science

5dmadm,0,"Sssssssoooooooo, what I just read was that scientists have been able to make an improvement to a system which has been subjected to howeverlongblue-greenalgaehaveexistedfor years of evolution. This is incredible. I know we've been making more efficient things than nature for a while now, but tweaking one of the oldest, most well-established processes of life on earth is astounding!",0,,,3,science
5dmadm,1,"It's pretty common actually. Look at e.g. orange carrots. Or, for that matter, a tractor vs. a horse.

The difference is: we have different priorities. The conservative approach may indeed be best for the offspring of the plants in the wilderness - but what is best for the plant is not the same as is what is best for the farmer.",0,,,6,science
5dmadm,2,"Obviously I didn't make that clear enough. What you're referring to are changes of preference or optimisations of artificial systems (horses don't naturally plough fields). This is an optimisation of a completely natural system, something we didn't invent that has existed for almost as long as life itself.",0,,,2,science
5dmadm,0,"May I ask a non-scientist question?

What would be the main crops that would benefit the most from this kind of bioengineering? Maize? Rice?",0,,,2,science
5dmadm,1,"guess i'll give a nonscientist answer: all of the crops.

most non-crop plants have an efficiency around 0.2%, crop plants are between 2% and 7% (the only 7% being sugar cane, most are closer to the 2-3% range) 

now it's unclear if this is a 15% increase on the 2-3% or if it's 15 percentage points over...but it's probably the former so if it was 2% it's now 2.3% efficient...if it's the latter it's now 17% efficient. but if that was they case they would say ""over 7x more efficient""",0,,,5,science
5dmadm,0,[removed],0,,,2,science
5dmadm,0,"""""Niyogi and his colleagues realized that plants were taking too long to shut that safety valve once they were safely in the shade.""""

Really? Still someone thinks that billions of years of evolution can make such a ""mistake""? Like a plant doesn't have any kind of incentive in being as efficient as possible...",0,,,6,science
5dmadm,1,"Well evolution doesn't quite work that way. Often times inefficiencies are left in because 1) They are a side effect of something else that is providing more efficiency than is being lost. 2) The inefficiency doesn't *typically* hinder reproductive potential so the selection pressure is very low and/or 3) The inefficiency actually provides advantages in some edge cases.

Additionally, we humans have a very narrow definition of what is advantageous in a plant, which doesn't help the matter either.",0,,,28,science
5dmadm,2,"""They are a side effect of something else that is providing more efficiency than is being lost.""

So it is not really an inefficiency, isn't it? it a part of a trade off, a cog of the bigger process or more precisely, it is part of an inherently efficent system.
Anyway, my point was that a statement like that sound quite arrogant, more so because a plant is a complex organism that we can't say to fully understand (give ""fully"" its litteral meaning).",0,,,1,science
5dmadm,3,"I don't disagree with you, but I was more responding in the context of the original statement. Framing ""efficient"" and ""inefficient"" as how the plant fulfills the needs of people, not necessarily itself and explaining why these inefficiencies might still prosper in the face of selection, directed or otherwise.
",0,,,2,science
5dmadm,1,"The quenching mechanisms in plants would confer advantages in some stressful instances such as drought. Therefore selective pressures have shaped such a system to provide this ability to survive adverse conditions which are prevalent enough in nature to maintain the collection of traits in the present configuration.

In modern farming, however, the conditions are much more stable and plants probably do not need such a robust energy dissipation pathway. I would imagine that the improvements the researchers saw might be able to be produced by selective breeding but this would require continuous selective pressure (choosing the best yielding plants only to breed) which would be difficult to maintain. However, it is also possible that the configuration of the pathway is 'baked in' to plants and that there are not really any gene variants (at least in the species of interest) which will allow for this more efficient and yet likely more vulnerable configuration. There is also the matter of an interconnected system of quenchers and enzymes whereby changing one thing alters something else, making changes in such systems difficult, particularly in multi-cellular organisms with long generation times and low mutation rates.

It also follows that the system can possibly be configured in the other direction, allowing for plants that are less efficient and yet better able to survive stressful events. Which could be useful.

This is all just informed supposition on my part but I am trying to illustrate the competing demands and limitations with respect to evolutionary forces and expression of genetically programmed configurations in populations. It is a very 'human' thing to assume a kind of intelligence directing evolution, even well trained people are guilty of it from time to time.",0,,,9,science
5dmadm,2,"Yes I do agree and I kinda of understand the meaning of the sentence, but you will agree with me that it is a somewhat incorrect statement. A statement that at least betray an arrogance that I thought extincted among scientists.",0,,,2,science

A more fitting comparison would be ""Why human sleep so much? let's recode them so they can sleep much less!"". This, in my view, is the same error that has been done over and over again. The system is complex, so much complex that we don't fully understand it so the original statement (the one I quoted) is incorrect.",0,,,1,science
