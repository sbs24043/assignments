1b2a8ez,0,"> Zvomuya noted that the right-of-ways appeared to dry out faster than the rest of the field, likely because of heat from the pipeline. He showed photos of snow-covered fields that were bare over the pipe. The drying effect appeared to nullify any positive effects from the warmer temperature.

Interesting. Compaction is also a problem but the heat was something I hadn't thought about.",0,,,22,farming
1b2a8ez,0,"Make sure you get enough money out of them up front that its as close to paying for the ground outright as possible. That ground might look good on top but it'll never be the same. 

The edges of an easement usually aren't too bad as long as they have a decent crew of operators but wherever the trench was cut will be more or less ruined. Even if they say they're going to put the topsoil back on top.

Bottom line, get a lawyer experienced in easements like this to negotiate, even if that means they get a decent chunk of the money. It'll be worth it to make sure everything gets put in writing  properly.",0,,,13,farming

1b2a8ez,0,"The oil companies know about this. It is up to the farmers representatives to make a good deal on behalf of their clients.

The oil companies wish to keep the money in their pockets.


Samuel Van Syckle, an inventive oil worker from New Jersey, was one of the first to focus on transportation. Van Syckle constructed the first successful pipeline in 1865 that extended five miles and connected Pithole to the Oil Creek railroad. The logistics of transporting oil defined the early petroleum industry.",0,,,15,farming
1b2a8ez,0,"I agree fully.  Biggest issue I have is the failure to reestablish any vegetation at all over the last 6 years (!) resulting in serious erosion down the slope from the line itself.  Even resulted in the breach of my primary livestock watering tank (pond for the northerners). The reps claimed they are't responsible for anything off the line itself.  Lawyer retained and preparing for action.  

Get legal advice before agreeing to any pipeline contract as mentioned by others.",0,,,3,farming

1b2a8ez,2,I assume he means when they dig the trenches underground to hook up the windmills they fill with bad material but not sure. I’m curious to learn more too,0,,,4,farming

1b2a8ez,2,"Compaction and burying the topsoil

The equipment running over the right of way to install the windmill and the trench with the transmission line compacts the shit out of the soil. Pretty deep as well.  Deeper than your ripper or anything else that might break it up can reach.

Then there is the simple fact that dirt workers rarely pay attention to top soil versus clay.  So, typically they wind up burying the topsoil and leaving clay on top.

So essentially anything that's been disturbed takes many years for the soil chemistry and biology below the surface to return to what the rest of the field was.",0,,,5,farming
1b2a8ez,3,We've had windmills for over 10 years now and I can't see the transmission lines on the yield maps. We also have a number of pipelines including the original Keystone pipeline. I can still see from Google earth where it runs but nothing shows up on the yield monitor,0,,,7,farming
1b2a8ez,3,Got a couple spots around windmills. Chiseled every year but water just sits there. Water logged eventually ends up compacted again as it is the old wet part of the feild. Chisel it again and again but without a deep subsoiler it will never soak in right again.,0,,,3,farming
1b2a8ez,3,Got it.  Farms near me are under some high voltage lines.  But when they need to do maintenance on the towers they put down “swamp mats” (rubber or wood pallets that the heavy equipment drives on to spread out weight).  Maybe that’s something owners can require before they put up a tower.,0,,,2,farming
