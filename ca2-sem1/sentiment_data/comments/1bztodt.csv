1bztodt,0,"Anyone on here make silage out of sorghum sudan? Everything I've read says it produces huge biomass, but I never see anyone making silage out of it.",0,,,8,farming
1bztodt,1,Have done sudan in ont canada. Was happy with it. Tried feeding it wrapped to sheep. With some success. Be a better beef cow feed if just wrapping it. Also baler with knives is handy as well. Awful hard to get dry if it gets rained on as the winrows are so heavy and wet to begin with.,0,,,6,farming
1bztodt,2,"I don't know a whole lot about silage, never made it myself, but don't you want the greens to be wet before wrapping so it can ferment? Or is there a level where it becomes too wet?",0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,3,"There's a window.  Too wet and it gets gross, just a sopping wet mess.  Too dry and it's fine feed, but little or no fermentation.",0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,1,"I‚Äôve seen it done many times around Dayton, Va. Also a lot of wet wrap hay.",0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,1,With some Piper or Advance Grazer (Sudan type) you can actually do an early cut without toxicity (45 or 55cm) and make some kickass silage out of it faster.,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,2,"If I'm understanding correctly, does this mean other varieties of sorghum sudan are toxic when cut young?",0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,3,Yes ! Prussic acid and nitrate poisoning.,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,4,Wow I had no clue. Would you be able to cut rye when it's young? And probably couldn't do that with corn becuase of the plants structure eh?,0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,5,I'd love to talk about that more but i'm afraid the language barrier is making it difficult to express what I want to express. My English is ok in general but pretty darn bad when it comes to agricultural vocabulary :'(,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,6,No problem my friend!,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,3,But i'm pretty sure the prussic acid dissipate with the ensilling process tbh anyway,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,1,We are feeding it right now as part of our ration in our grow yard. Been feeding it for several years. Makes excellent feed. We purchase it out of irrigated fields. If I remember right it made it made about 17 tons an acre. Course a lot of that weight is water.,0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,0,"*slaps soil. ""That's not goin' *anywhere*!""",0,,,5,farming
1bztodt,0,I wonder how it compares to proper grass silage. I'm curious.,0,,,3,farming
1bztodt,1,"I am assuming the rye will be lesser quality than typical grass silage. Lots of fibre for the heifers, part of a TMR. We don‚Äôt grow any grass. Gets too hot and dry in the summer. Grow alfalfa instead. SW Ontario Canada",0,,,3,farming
1bztodt,0,This is the way!   Nice work,0,,,2,farming
1bztodt,0,A lot of guys do this in the Shenandoah Valley.,0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,0,I love that crop of popsicle sticks.,0,,,1,farming
1bztodt,0,Nice üòÅ how are you going to terminate? I'm going to experiment with crimping this year.,0,,,1,farming
