jsclq2,0, 'Emergent constraint on crop yield response to warmer temperature from field experiments'  [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0569-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0569-7),0,,,5,science
jsclq2,0,"Get ready for deep adaptation people, if we don't radically change the way we distribute and produce our foodcrops now, we will experience a global food crisis firsthand.",0,,,3,science
jsclq2,1,"Adapt or die. Sadly, many people would rather someone else die than have to adapt.

Countries like the UK or the US could probably manage on 10% of what they consume - if it was distributed properly",0,,,3,science
jsclq2,0,Did they account for high-latitude areas that will become more productive?,0,,,3,science
jsclq2,1,"Exisiting high-latitude grain belts will become more productive, but they are relatively small areas of good prairie loam. Thin boreal soils won't instantly become fertile.",0,,,2,science
jsclq2,2,"Are they missing organic matter, or something else?",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,3,"Yes, the best temperate farm soils generally evolve as grasslands, with lots of organic material growing and dying each year, piling up over millennia into deep, dark topsoils. The Canadian prairies are good examples, but these thin out into poorer soils to the north and east.",0,,,2,science
jsclq2,4,"Look, I'm the newbie Layman here so feel free to destroy me...

\-But shouldn't be putting solar panels on the dead land, and farming less animals for the meat industry, saving much water & grain and focusing on producing cost efficient crops thru new methods of cultivation?

\-If Elon can build a Gigafactory, why can't we build an Aeroponic Gigafarm or Two?",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,5,"We already see lots of solar development in lower latitudes, and we'll soon see lots more. However, keeping food supply robust will become very challenging.

Hydroponics at scale are expensive, and usually devoted to vegetables. The Netherlands grows lots of Europe's tomatoes and lettuce indoors, but corn and wheat would be harder because yields per acre are lower. 

Price is the issue. For example, when the Russian wheat crop collapsed in 2010 due to a record heat wave, it drove up bread prices 40% in North Africa, resulting in food riots and then the Arab Spring revolutions. Growing grain indoors would drive up prices in similar fashion.

When we talk about food shortages due to low yields, the prices won't destroy folks in rich countries, but they'll set poor countries aflame.",0,,,2,science
jsclq2,6,"It will take Worldwide co-operation to organize a fail-proof supply chain but things can be done on a small scale to help more impoverished communities and if successful, scale them up

\-I'm thinking the problem is we're tying to change the food industry instead of creating additional food supplies, like energy efficient structures Aeroponic systems for certain high yielding crops, that could even be totally AI run systems, and above ground growing like they do in Japan to totally control crop output...and maybe any surplus energy/crops could be sold off to pay for cultivation for the bigger land crops

\-Supply & demand is another problem as we want what others have and refrigerating & transporting these foods to us causes much environmental damage, but we could grow similarly exotic foods more locally.

Anyhoo, thanks for the excellent comments, have a nice Friday and beyond",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,4,"> but these thin out into poorer soils to the north and east.

Makes sense given that the last ice age's North American ice cap scraped all the topsoil away in those areas.",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,5,"Indeed, and the best grasslands often developed near the margins of the ice sheets where drifts of pulverized glacial loess piled up.",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,1,"Not sure.

But I know these areas will only be productive if we start farming them now",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,0,"From what I've studied you just need two ingredients for life: heat and water. If it's too cold water gets frozen, desert forms. If it's too dry because of heat and not enough reposition of water, you get another type of desert. This is probably the type that they're counting on happening. But if humanity invested in major projects like bringing air moisture to desserts, you could make new arable land. E.g. digging a canal that brought ocean water inside Africa. 
Also, they're not taking into consideration new highly productive hydroponic techniques.",0,,,2,science
jsclq2,1,"Water is a very valuable commodity and cultivating land is expensive so Aeroponics are the way forward

\-Solar panels powering Aeroponic systems that can use as little as 10% of the water that regular irrigation methods use could be a cost effective way to produce crops in harsh climates",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,0,"Yet another ""new"" study showing that warming temps and rising drought will depress crop yields. 

If anything, this study is less alarming than others [like this](https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2017/01/19/Climate-change-to-depress-crop-yields-in-the-United-States-new-study-claims/2751484858953/).",0,,,2,science
jsclq2,1,"It's a global study and that one is a study on crops in America

But both are way above my pay grade!",0,,,1,science
jsclq2,0,But won’t there also be an increase in arable acreage?  So more farmland but less efficient?,0,,,4,science
jsclq2,1,"This is true. Not sure how it incorporates into these predictions. It would require clearing of forests in northern climates (mostly Canada and Russia), and moving northern latitude crops into those zones, while shifting southern latitude crops north as well. Our tropical zones would also expand somewhat, but if the heating is too extreme, humans may not be able to live anywhere near them.",0,,,6,science
jsclq2,2,"Not to mention, the soil isn't the same, the infrastructure isn't there, the hours of daylight won't change. While cold-adapted crops like wheat may be able to move further north with no problem, warmer climate crops (like soy and cotton, and to lesser extent, corn) may not be as flexible.

What we may gain in arable land might not exceed what we lose.",0,,,7,science
jsclq2,3,"  ""direct warming impacts alone will reduce major crop yields by 3–13% under 2 K global warming without considering CO2 fertilization effects and adaptations""

IMO by the time we come up with a plan those %'s will be higher & there will millions more people displaced....the problems are many, more famers in poor places grow narcotics because there's a better mark up",0,,,3,science
