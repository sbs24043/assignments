I could see that stream of nutrients used to power coppice forestry to generate the fine wood chips to provide the needed carbon to balance the nitrogen from the waste materials.

qo6ery,2,It just uses wind power instead of fossil fuels. No one cares where the energy comes from if the product is made.,0,,,2,news

qo6ery,1,"Most phosphorous applied to soils winds up converting to plant unavailable forms but remains there.    If they stop applying available phosphorous, microbes and fungi in the soil gradually unlock that unavailable phosphorous and supply it to plants.   Returning more organic matter to the soil provides food for those organisms.    At this point, there's decades worth of phosphorous stored in the soil already so when mined supplies run out it will require a change in farming techniques, but won't be the disaster people like to portray.",0,,,3,news

Of the worlds crop calories - only 55% is fed to humans  (rest is fed to animals or burned as ethanol).

1. We'll all be eating less meat.  
2. We'll all be trying to learn how to back yard garden.
3. The restaurant industry will collapse.
4. Frozen vegetables will become more popular
5. Shelf stable starches like pasta and rice will be more popular

qo6ery,1,Ha we already do all that in my household.,0,,,4,news
qo6ery,1,"What you'll see first is countries that aren't garbage dumping mountains of subsidies on producers so food prices won't explode. 

Next you'll see food exporting countries, like the US, cut their food exports. Not going to be fun if you happen to be a food importing country. 

If things still haven't stabilized and it looks like legitimate mass food shortages might start happening you'll see the fertilizer flow directed into actual food production and out of places like ethanol.
