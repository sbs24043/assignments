Now go rent land for 150$ per. 

Or make payments on it.

Edit: I’m not sure if you’re just running an exercise or if you’re planning to farm your ten acres.",0,,,44,farming

197fab4,2,Good to look at make sure you also look at the high and avg over different time frame.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,0,"Custom planting rates here are 20 an acre, tillage 15 for finishing and 20-30 for primary. Possibly 40-50 for application between Chem and fertilizer depending on how many trips it takes. Combine is 30. You still have to haul, dry and store. Drying if needed could be .25 to .50 per bushel depending on the year. If you hire custom work you’re now in the hole. What kind of Chem and fert package did you pick that costs 200 per acre each??",0,,,11,farming
197fab4,1,I really wasn't sure on the Chem so I just clicked all the options. Was thinking a basic post emerge roundup application. No pre emerge or anything like that.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,2,"Ok that makes sense. roundup and status is a pretty reliable post mix, with additives would be 45 ish per acre. Would recommend using a pre as well though.",0,,,3,farming
197fab4,3,So maybe a little underpriced on the labor costs and overpriced on the chem?,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,4,For this area yes. I know some parts of the world have to throw the kitchen sink at resistant weeds though.,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,5,"We don't have a big issue here in the 15 mile radius area as it's not the best ground anyway and most of it is still farmed as if it's 1980. I do have an ""in"" with a neighbor so my labor costs will be somewhat lower than normal.",0,,,2,farming

197fab4,2,"What about taxes? Insurance? Even here, where taxes are relatively low, they still come out to \~$35/acre a year.",0,,,10,farming
197fab4,2,Still need to factor that in or you're an idiot for farming it for $74  instead of renting it for more...,0,,,20,farming
197fab4,3,In my area alot of ground is rented for around 50 an acre. I know multiple landowners who don't charge rent at all they just want the tax break.,0,,,4,farming
197fab4,4,[deleted],0,,,12,farming
197fab4,5,Guys grow alot of 150+ bushel corn. We just don't have the competition for the land. Mostly small dairy farms and most of them own their land. It has started changing though in the last 5 years or so. Number of cash crop operations has doubled. None are very big though.,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,6,[deleted],0,,,6,farming
197fab4,7,"It's a small area, southern tier of NY. The land here is hilly and mainly populated with small Mennonite or 3+ generation dairies. Alot of ""hobby"" farmers who cut 20 acres of hay to feed their 6 cows. If you go 30 minutes North, East or West it's completely different, dominated by big dairies who fight over every acre. In my immediate area there are 3 times as many acres of state forest land as farm land.",0,,,7,farming

197fab4,1,And definitely the only subreddit where corn loses money.,0,,,3,farming

197fab4,0,Factor in a drought and 80bu corn and then you'll lose the fun aspect,0,,,5,farming
197fab4,1,Ya that's with anything though.,0,,,3,farming
197fab4,0,"Depends on your area imo.  Call local suppliers/applicators of chemicals and seed and see what they are actually charging.

Also, you have property taxes/rent, equipment maintenance costs/repairs, electric/gas/water, fuel, etc...",0,,,3,farming
197fab4,1,I'm hiring everything done. I don't own the equipment. My cost is purely custom operators.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,2,[deleted],0,,,7,farming
197fab4,3,I fortunately would have that kind of connection.,0,,,5,farming
197fab4,0,I’m confused. I’m also not a farmer but this popped up on my feed so here’s my question. 150 bushels at $4 per bushel does not equal $6000. What am I missing?,0,,,3,farming
197fab4,1,"150 bushels per acre times 10 acres is 1500 bushels times $4 is $6,000. 

Saying a crop is a 150 bushel crop is farmer talk for the yield per acre essentially.",0,,,8,farming
197fab4,2,Thanks!,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,1,150 bushels per acre x 10 acres x 4$ a bushel = 6000$,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,0,"Here’s how I’m hoping to do it this year: $0 chemicals, $0 fertilizer, $640 seed.  4 acres with about 15,000 ears per acre, 60,000 ears.  You pick at $8 a dozen, I expect half to sell and half to retain for seed and animal feed.  So 30,000 ears at $8 a dozen is $20,000.  There will be a few days of field prep and planting, then setting up irrigation.  I have a campground on the farm and I’m starting to focus more on selling things to the campers, so far they buy beef, pork, and eggs at higher end retail prices, I just got a couple ice machines at the auction to sell bags of ice, and now I want to have you pick fruit and corn for them too.",0,,,5,farming
197fab4,1,This is interesting. There are a few local guys that are starting to sell bagged shell corn. 50lb bag for 10 bucks. Essentially doubles the price per bushel and the overall value of the corn. No one is living off that but hunting and smaller hobby farms are big here so there is a customer base for that. I personally buy bagged shell corn from a neighbor.,0,,,3,farming
197fab4,2,"Everything pencils out much better if you’re retailing.  I sell a half dozen eggs for $4 and a dozen for $8, nobody bats an eye, I sell firewood for $8 a bundle and of course a I sell a whole pig piece by piece at retail rates, it makes everything make way more sense and I don’t need to worry about shipping.  I do also do some traditional ag, I have a few alfalfa stands and I bale hay to sell local but I load in the field, again I always avoid transport costs.  You need to get yourself some camp sites, mine are $37 a night for dry camping, I have ten of them, and from May to September most of them are booked every night, and then I have customers on site to sell stuff to.",0,,,5,farming
197fab4,3,Last year sweet corn on the same 10 acres was double or more the profit per acre. Locally a dozen ears of sweet corn got as high as $8 and at auction $12. Only small amount of fertilizer cost and all hand picked with no chemical application. Little more hand work but very easily worth it.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,4,"That’s what I’m shooting for, I have a few smaller paddocks I was rotating cows through but they got overgrazed so I’m going to rip them up and plant a few different things to reset them and I’ll cover crop the rest.",0,,,2,farming
197fab4,5,We've done the meat thing but I did it poorly and just didn't keep good enough records of costs and profit. Now have 2 young children so probably won't get back into that for a couple years. We did well selling baby chick's in 2020. After that the fad of backyard birds faded pretty fast.,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,6,"Here those things are going strong, tons of people moving to Montana right now want that life",0,,,1,farming
197fab4,2,"Yep, a good corn sheller is not terribly expensive either, I've shelled a shitload of dent corn in my youth. Then you can do popcorn too. I'm planning about a quarter acre of just popcorn this year and will have that bagged up to sell at the following year's farmer's markets. The guy above could have it popped and ready to go for his campers. Yeah it's more labor, but the direct to retail is where you can do much better than the bin.",0,,,1,farming

197fab4,0,"Im not a farmer but damn, im gonna buy some corn futures now.",0,,,4,farming
197fab4,1,I have no idea if this is realistic. And $720 total profit on 10 acres isn't exactly life changing lol.,0,,,5,farming
197fab4,2,Ya man sounds like corn is underpriced.,0,,,2,farming
197fab4,3,Especially when you figure decent cropland is $15k an acre. Take a few hundred years to pay off at that rate.,0,,,7,farming

197fab4,0,Just wait until those ethanol subsidies are gone. Corn is gonna shit the bed. I can't wait,0,,,3,farming
197fab4,1,I’m all for sustainable farming but ethanol is a complete waste of money.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,2,Wait until the airline industry switches to 100% soy biofuel then the nonsense in corn pricing around ethanol will just be repeated for crush soy,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,0,"Your numbers look a bit high.   Here in black soil CPI 90+ soil of MN, rent is $250/acre.    They harvest 250 bushel per acre

Fertilizer is like $500-700/acre.   

Profit for people renting is usually $200-500/acre.   At $70, you are wasting your time.

Contract planting and harvest should still net you at least $100/acre",0,,,1,farming
197fab4,1,"They could be high, I figured overpricing is better than underpricing. Land rent here in my immediate area is commonly around 50-100 and I know multiple landowners that don't charge rent they just want the land in agriculture for the tax break.

197fab4,0,"Surprised you can get FBN corn with just ten acres invested.  Most
Tillage is around 20$ in NY.   Account for taxes as they aren’t cheap in NY.   Drying costs.   Planting cost me 30$ this year",0,,,1,farming
197fab4,1,I became an FBN member quite a few years ago soon after they started. I also used them because their website is the easiest to use and find things on and they actually post prices.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,2,How much is the annual membership if you don’t mind sharing ?   My big thing is they have no boots on the ground.   No service after the sale.,0,,,1,farming
197fab4,3,"It's free. I've never paid them a dime for any membership fees. That being said they may now charge a fee but I've been a member since 2018 I think, maybe 2019. Even though I don't farm and don't buy anything from them they still call and check in every spring. I have worked with their real estate people and thames have bee very helpful. Sometimes just answering general questions that have nothing to do with doing business with them. If you are near oneof their hub centers then I am sure they have-nots on the ground service. There are farmers who work with them as sales reps and bulk storage and distribution.",0,,,1,farming
