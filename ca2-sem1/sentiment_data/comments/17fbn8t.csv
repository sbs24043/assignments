17fbn8t,0,Holy sh‚Ä¶..,0,,,13,farming
17fbn8t,1,Probably be my reaction to the fertilizer bill as well.,0,,,17,farming
17fbn8t,2,"Just 400lbs of N, 135lbs of P, 315lbs of K and 51lbs of S or so. Those are also rough numbers if you find yourself baling the straw up.

Its really nice to see wheat pushing corn yields myself. It also appears that the forest fire smoke didn't limit yields as much as some people want to admit.

If he sold at today's prices, would be about 1500USD an acre I believe.",0,,,7,farming
17fbn8t,3,"In my part of the world, you could do that and still not see a huge difference. Soft red winter can be babied or treated like a red headed stepchild sometimes and get similar results.",0,,,5,farming
17fbn8t,4,"I've definitely had huge success last couple years growing soft red under high management, but nothing beats 36-40 days of perfect grain fill.",0,,,2,farming
17fbn8t,5,Darn right. That‚Äôs the trump card of grain yield.,0,,,4,farming
17fbn8t,2,Yup. Only paddock he didn‚Äôt lose money this year. üòÇ.,0,,,1,farming
17fbn8t,1,Can you wheat guys give us a clue on how big this is?  Is that 200% of a normal yield or ‚Ä¶?,0,,,5,farming
17fbn8t,2,Well over 2x the yields we get in Kentucky,0,,,7,farming
17fbn8t,2,I farm in SW ND and we average 40-50‚Äôs depending on rain,0,,,6,farming
17fbn8t,2,"According to the article, it looks like the average for a normal crop is in the 50s and the people who entered the competition were getting 130-170s with the winner being the 211.",0,,,6,farming
17fbn8t,2,100 is a damn nice crop.,0,,,3,farming
17fbn8t,0,"When people post records like this, are they planting a small section of their property and gunning for a record on purpose, or is this a record of one whole farm's entire normal operation over one season? Is there a minimum plot size that you take your average from?

And what kind of stuff do people who go for records do to achieve them, and over how many acres do you try it? Can't be cheap if it requires intensive active inputs.",0,,,9,farming
17fbn8t,1,Looks like 5ac plot minimum with 1.5ac minimum harvest.,0,,,10,farming
17fbn8t,2,Ah so each competition has rules and they sign up for it.,0,,,5,farming
17fbn8t,1,"Some of the things done on the small acre trials can be moved to large scale production. 

On my farm we trialed humic acid and molasses in addition to our spray program. Now every time the sprayer goes out, every acre covered gets a litre of humic acid and molasses. Crop quality is up, yield is up, test weight is up, disease pressures down.",0,,,6,farming
17fbn8t,2,Molasses huh? That's weird and nifty. What does it do?,0,,,4,farming
17fbn8t,3,"Depends where you are. At a minimum, alters the carbon to nitrogen ratio and can work as an adjuvant for spray mixes.",0,,,5,farming
17fbn8t,4,"Also just simple food for the soil microorganisms, residue break down has improved. Some of it I think the growing plants take up and makes a good send of energy",0,,,4,farming
17fbn8t,5,That's wild. What's the application rate? 1L into how much solution?,0,,,1,farming
17fbn8t,6,We do a litre per acre. So if the sprayer is doing 100 acres we load up 100L of molasses in the mix,0,,,2,farming
17fbn8t,0,Rain is a wonderful thing.,0,,,4,farming
17fbn8t,1,"Me: Nature, can we please have just enough rain, but not too much, at just the right times‚Ä¶ 
Nature: Best I can do is no rain all June and 14‚Äù in two days right at harvest time",0,,,3,farming
17fbn8t,2,"Nature also : I see you just planted. Here is 6‚Äù of rain in 2 hours. Let‚Äôs go ahead and flood out those field bottoms. Ok Now , that‚Äôs all the rain you get for a while. ( Proceeds to drought to allow the tops of the fields dry up ).",0,,,2,farming
17fbn8t,2,Haha for real! I always say I can complain about the weather whenever I want because I‚Äôm a farmer.,0,,,1,farming
