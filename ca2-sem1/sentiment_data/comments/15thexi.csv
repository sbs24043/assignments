I wish I was your BS/MS advisor right now…",0,,,8,farming
15thexi,0,So world hunger solved. Environment saved. Food engineered to be healthier. Farmers are going to be rich! What a time to be alive.,0,,,3,farming
15thexi,1,">Farmers are going to be rich!

Haha. I wish...",0,,,2,farming
15thexi,2,"Actually what kills farmers is the low quality of the goods that are produced with chemicals and cheap labour/diesel/monoculture... If we get small garden robots for 5000 dollars that can farm 2 basketballs courts of food, that's like paying 3 labourers full time for 500 dollars per year. the machine lasts 15 years, uses 150 in energy, and 150 in spare parts annualy. I can design that machine if you give me 3 million, i will open source the software so that you can program the robot to do custom tasks.",0,,,0,farming
15thexi,3,">low quality of the goods that are produced with chemicals and cheap labour/diesel/monoculture


Yes, we use chemicals. Yes, we use machinery that uses diesel. There is no alternative currently.


Organic farming is a lot more money and work, and you aren't making that much more. There's a reason few people do it.


Why would I give you 3 million to design a machine that I wouldn't benefit from? A small robot isn't going to combine 5000 acres for me.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,0,"Dude, all you spewed was a bunch of 'look at us, how smart we are' gobbledygook that only does one thing: mitigate the labor, especially human labor, aspect of agriculture, which is not always a good thing. Hand work replaced by machine work replaced by chemical work...environmental recovery very hard, imbalance of inputs causing catastrophic failures. Please reassess.",0,,,4,farming
15thexi,1,"No way... automation is about reducing human labour... I want farmers to OWN the automation, just like you own an ebike or an EV, you can own a garden robot that has a telescope arm that does digging, amendment, irrigation, weeding, seed sowing, using a multitool automatic tool changer.",0,,,2,farming
15thexi,2,"Sorry, your comparison is not acceptable, a gardener is not analogous to even a subsistence farmer. To get to this level of automation, the homogenization of the foodstuffs produced tend to be very much inferior in nutrition to the crops of the origin seedstock.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"It’s AI written. 

All it does is add a bunch of big words, commas, and fancy phrases. At first it seems super smart but it really says nothing and is unclear.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,0,"Interestingly enough, GPS will end up being the end for row crop farmers as we know them. 

There will be no need for someone to drive equipment. 
The equipment will be too advanced for anyone except trained technicians to work on. Drones can look at the crops. 

We will be sitting behind desks on computers.

Corporations and China know this, hence the massive purchases of farm land.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"Two things that made me realise I was watching the end of manned cropping. WeedSeeker has existed in Australia for a while (a system where each nozzle on a spray rig has a sensor that detects weeds and sprays as it passes them) big problem is that during dry times the sensors get covered in dust and struggle. So the new setup is a drone that maps the paddock with the same sensors and GPS marks all the weeds. The file is transferred to the spray rig and it sprays based off of the coordinates of each nozzle. The drone can map 400Ha/Hour and the system reduced herbicide use Astronomically. 

I activated auto turn on my Trimble in the Fendt recently and couldn't help but think, what is the point of me being in here. Yes it took time to get the paddock set up correctly for the GPS but then I just hit auto steer and let it go. The next time I go in the paddock I might need to make some minor adjustments to make sure it's following the exact tracks but that's it, within a season I'll have all the cropping mapped in the GPS and literally anyone with a 10 minute introduction could come and drive it for simple things like cultivation. 

The Fendt is 2 years old, I can easily see myself looking at going into unmanned when it needs replacing",0,,,5,farming
15thexi,2,Do you know the name of the drone company that does the mapping?,0,,,1,farming

15thexi,4,Thanks.   There’s a US company doing this as well.  A little different.,0,,,1,farming
15thexi,2,"An Aussie driving a Fendt seems so crazy to me. 

Until fairly recently, I had never seen a Fendt outside of Bavaria [and they looked like this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b3/e0/c3/b3e0c3c6de88d0c402e7e082f82915c1--bayern-farmer.jpg) and being driven by [a guy who looked like this.](https://www.bayerische-staatszeitung.de/fileadmin/_processed_/4/9/csm_Bauer_2cfe7b1d54.jpg)

But I’m not totally surprised they hit the international market. One thing I remarked in Bavaria was how they tend to overbuild their machines. You see contraptions made of WOOD that look like they’ve been in service for fifty years, and I once saw a dewatering pump on a mine tour that ran for over a century and *never once needed repair.* But it looked like it was forged out of a solid brass billet, so go figure. I always buy Bavarian boots now. Bought the last pair in 2008. Still doing fine.",0,,,1,farming

15thexi,1,"For the last 10 years, dad says he expects that some day we'll pull up to a field with a trailer load of mini drone planters, like 2 or 4 row units. They'd unload themselves and do their thing. You'd probably have a refill station where they'd return to for seed and starter. They could run all day and night",0,,,2,farming
15thexi,2,"I think I'll see actual full tractors running as drones.

Like my 9RX 640 without a cab. It will even drive itself to the field.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"No way, humans will be working in the field with co-bots... There is nothing better than free food. Imagine ""croppertunity rover"" which can map, irrigate, water, dispense seeds, for 150 per year energy cost. people will on the contrary be able to buy their own land and depend on local farming rather than massive elite farms.

The governments are the ones encourageing hypermarkets and hyperfarms, it's all rigged tax wise and it's time to reclaim the land and get co-bots.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"Where is this ""massive purchases of farm land"" going on?  Out west, back east, because it's not going on in Illinois.",0,,,0,farming
15thexi,2,A lotttttttttttt of land has traded hands in Michigan since the beginning of Covid.,0,,,0,farming
15thexi,3,And you've looked all these sales up and you know it's corporations and the Chinese?,0,,,1,farming
15thexi,4,"No, not at all. It could be anyone. I was watching a lot of big parcels for a while and they all got snapped up kind of “more suddenly than usual.” It’s speculative purchase, (I assume.) Most were not currently farmland. Many were not cleared.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,2,West. They want complete unbroken sections of land.,0,,,1,farming
15thexi,3,Why?,0,,,1,farming
15thexi,4,"Who wouldn't want flat, open, square fields? Farm land is also cheaper once you get out of the trees into the prarie.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,5,"I'm on the prairie, no cheap or cheaper land here. 

What are they growing, wheat, alfalfa, subdivisions?",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,6,"Wheat, alfalfa, corn, sometimes they don't grow a damn thing they just lease it out. 

$14,000/acre is pretty cheap ground. 

Go west into Wyoming and Montana that shit is cheap. 
I've seen 36,000 acres sell for $15 million.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,0,"Is this some kind of masterbratory celebration of the death of the family farm? Because sure sounds like a good way to corporatize and cut out all farm labor. Sure, small farms can and have benefited from ag advances, but if you think we want to celebrate monocrop fields and drones doing all the work, you're a bit mistaken. This just comes off sounding like big ops doing more of the same, depleting water and topsoil at record pace, to drive down product prices for everyone else in the name of profit. Sure we know better now how to build soil, but don't kid yourself about them really doing it -their stockholders won't allow it.

All this tech does not support the little guy or local food production and processing. Of course there's no money in it, but if we want to keep farming sustainable, we'll be paying that price either way.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"As I see it, farmers in the future will be able to buy ebike sized rovers that multitask and do the most tedious jobs for fruit and vegetables, so the farmer can basically have a laugh and just tidy the robot 20 minutes every time it does 3 days of work and focus on fine -tunign ecology and planning.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,2,"Until one of these multi-tasking farmer versions of Johnny5 down to $6k, its not going to help my operation in the slightest.

But you're also missing my point. If we are doing all this on the production end and not seriously overhauling the processing and distribution, the only ones who will benefit are the ones who are already huge and controlling the market.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,0,"Umm, I don’t see how CRISPR-Cas9 mitigates controversy *at all.*

Personally, I am not paranoid about transgenics in most cases. But CRISPR is a way to chop up DNA and insert new stuff, and Cas9 is just a more efficient way to do CRISPR. 

I kind of agree with the other guy who suggested that this was written by AI. 

I would also like to mention the utter fucking bullshit surrounding trying to repair all the new-tangled shit.",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,0,"Curious, GPT-3 or GPT-4?",0,,,1,farming
15thexi,1,"Only GPT 3. agro technology is pretty interesting to synthesize using GPT, it's pretty amazing as a synthesis engine. 

I am a big fan of small garden robots. quadcopters can deliver mail, robot mowers have 50% of the market share, so i think it's only time till people have their food grown free...

The market incentive is there, fruit and veg are worth as much as the family car or the brent crude industries, but tractors are working not much different than 1975 at the moment.
