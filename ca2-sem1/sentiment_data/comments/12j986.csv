12j986,2,"Nitrogen is an element. It's also the name used for nitrogen gas, which has two atoms of nitrogen to make one molecule of nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrogen is also used to refer to the ammonium and nitrate content of soil.

When you say ""synthetically made nitrogen"", you must be referring to the last. The atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, so it's pointless to synthesize the molecule, and monoatomic nitrogen is much less table than the two-atom molecule.

There are many ways to add nitrogen to the soil. This is called ""nitrogen fixation."" There are microorganisms which can do it alone, and microorganisms which are in symbiosis with plants like legumes. The plants are either planted at the same time as the crop (an example of 'companion planting' is the 'three sisters' of corn, beans, and squash, where the beans help fixate the soil. This article uses a tree instead of a legume), or through a rotation cycle, where one of the phases of the cycle is with a fixating plant.

Or we can synthesize ammonia via the Haber process and inject that directly into the solid. (These are the large tanks you might see in a farm, labeled ""anhydrous"".)

The farmers in the region being studied are poor in terms of both cash and effective labor, so the fact that  Gliricidia, as a perennial, offers increased crop yields without increased annual monetary outlay (for chemical fertilizer or leguminous annual seed) and/or the need to spend additional time (and possibly money) planting annual leguminous plants each year is of real significance. The use of legumes to preserve soil fertility has [never really seized hold](http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5488e/x5488e0e.htm) in Sub-Saharan Africa in the same way it has elsewhere in the world, so if usage of perennial leguminous plants rather than annuals can allow that to happen it would be a pretty big deal

With that being said though, One of the main points of the [actual study](https://www.agronomy.org/publications/aj/abstracts/104/5/1392)  was that intercropping with Gliricidia in fact results in more stable yearly yields than annual chemical fertilization, and that if used in conjunction with chemical fertilizers, Gilricada intercropping allowed for yearly yields higher than seen with fertilizer usage alone even while the applied amount of fertilizer (with its attendant monetary cost) was dropped by 50%.

Secondly: yield is a relative term. While these increased yields are amazing they could be an improvement on low total crop.

Finally, while it is great that these yield increases exist they probably won't be achieved in first world crop systems. The reasons behind this are *many* but could include irrigation water being used by trees and decreased absolute effect on the crop.

I doubt it is the nitrogen fixation that makes the difference, from what I have heard it takes a while before the nitrogen nodules on the root become available to other plants other then the legume.

I can almost guarantee you that in places in africa with low nitrogen, these techniques have been in use for centuries"" 

But here's a bit of information:

They aren't ""nitrogen-high plants""

Bacteria that are naturally in the soil take nitrogen from the air and use it to create plant-available forms, and it is fixated in the soil.

Legumes have special nodules that allow these bacteria to live inside the roots, while the plants feed it nutrients and they get nitrogen in return. 
A lot of it is left in the soil during the plant's life cycle.

You can buy the inoculations of bacteria in most supply stores.



And Africa NEEDS GM crops. The main issue is feeding everybody. You want to get the most supply you can possibly get. Imposing artificial restrictions like trying to avoid using GM crops is nonsense.

I worry about corporations having so much power over our food supplies but I completely agree that we cannot feed the world without them.

For example, you can actually plant several crops in the same rows and they can be totally complimentary. 

Corn, beans and strawberries/squash for example.  Strawberries/squash are panted between the rows and are ready in late June, the corn and beans grow together all summer and the beans are able to actually use the corn for support as they climb and the corn grows.  

If you let chickens run in the fields as well their are few pests to worry about. 

Imagine a world where we go back to smaller local farms producing a diverse line of food that is ultimately healthier, more productive per acre and ultimately more sustainable.
