ohaqax,0,I always find the regional yeild expectations funny. I assume 50bu there is a solid crop? Typical yeild would be 40?,0,,,6,farming
ohaqax,1,"Yield monitor isn‚Äôt calibrated, but yes 50 bpa is a good yield here. Our APH on this field is right at 40 bpa. I think this field is doing more like 70 based on the truck loads we‚Äôve taken. A really good yield here would be 80-100 bpa, but we don‚Äôt spend that kinda cash on fertilizer. Probably would have paid this year with over 10‚Äù of spring moisture. Based on the way the crop looked I was expecting HUGE yields but we had an extreme heat wave in early June with temps to 107 that shriveled the kernels. Our crop consultant said the heat took 15%-25% off the top end.",0,,,8,farming
ohaqax,2,"WOW.  That is a major hit, I guess the Lord giveth and taketh",0,,,2,farming
ohaqax,3,Yes He does. Pretty much a 24/7/365 character building exercise!,0,,,3,farming
ohaqax,2,"80bu is our yeild goal. Last year we avg over 100. One customer of ours who was convinced wheat was a waste of time and money finally grew some last year, its avg 127bu. That was a outstanding year. 2019 had lots of 60bu wheat. We had a strong crop in spring, then excessively moisture, then drought through final growth, heading, flower and filling. So I'm not super excited on what yeild will be.",0,,,2,farming
ohaqax,3,Where you at with that kind of yield?,0,,,1,farming

ohaqax,4,"Neighbors yeild was a outlier though, old guy with money who enjoys just seeing what yeild he can get. It's fun to do the work where someone can afford to throw the kitchen sink at it and see what is a benefit and what isnt",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,3,"Some guys in better ground consistently hit over 80 bu. Maybe one day when I‚Äôm not just low guy on the family totem pole, I‚Äôll aim for higher yield goals.",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,4,"I know that feeling.  We had about 200 acres good land in wheat this year and it averaged 85.  The other 600 acres is sand and it rained constantly all winter long.  Didn't drown, but couldn't keep fertilizer on it and can't afford to keep applying and putting it on the creeks so it picked awful.",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,1,"It's not just regional.  We plant fields that will never yield over 45-50 on a perfect year and generally make 30.  We also plant fields that have potential for 120-140 but average 85-90.  

Best part is they are across the road from each other half the time.

I've been trying to convince the family that planting the 30bu fields is a waste of time.",0,,,3,farming
ohaqax,2,"Possibly, but for our especially hilly ground, it‚Äôll hold the ground in place as well.",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,3,"Yea, it's basically cover crop we fertilize, spray, and pick.  We'd be better off just planting cover crop on it though.  

Most years anyway.  This season we got $7/bu wheat and even at 30bu/acre  we came out slightly ahead.",0,,,3,farming
ohaqax,4,I know people who just refer to wheat as poverty grass. Makes me chuckle,0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,5,Last year everybody called cotton poverty lint.  Planting it when it's $0.40 is rough.  But it went up by harvest,0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,2,"Possibly, but for our especially hilly ground, it‚Äôll hold the ground in place as well.",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,2,"Oh for sure, we have land that we dont bother with wheat in. Some it won't even over winter in it due to wet feet and others will have a awesome stand but July comes and there just heads full of aborted kernels and expensive straw",0,,,1,farming
ohaqax,0,Do you know how that thing scans for protein? Is it something like an NIR with a calibration in it from a wheat lab to predict protein yield?,0,,,3,farming
ohaqax,1,It doesn‚Äôt scan protein. They grind and test protein at the grain facility for each load we deliver.,0,,,6,farming
