That is a silage cutter not a grain harvester.  Silage being the whole plant chopped (corn in this case I believe) into tiny pieces for livestock feed... So they didn't lose much money on this mistake...if even $50 total from the entirety of this gif id be surprised.",0,,,509,funny

2mpf5c,5,"No significant nitrogen from silage. Legumes return the nitrogen into the ground while corn sucks it up. that's why you'll see a crop rotation. Soybeans will give you 20-30+ credits of nitrogen. Then you add more either through fertilizer, anhydrous ammonia, liquid 28, or liquid 32. You're best off to space out your applications so you don't lose that much through leaching and other weather related issues. On a true crop rotation, I do: fall applied nh3, pre plant 28 incorporated with tillage, then a v4 stage side dress with 32. Total nitrogen varies per farmer but I do a .8# nitrogen/bushel of expected corn. So 200bu of corn needs 160# nitrogen. ",0,,,2,funny

2mpf5c,2,"Every year we let our cattle out on harvested corn fields (ones with adiquate fences) and let them graze off the fields.  They will find most of the corn that gets thrashed out or the ears that fell off the plant before harvest.  They'll eat up a lot of the thrashed cobs and leaves that got ran through the combine and ultimately clean up a lot of the residual trash left behind from the plant. This helps because if the corn crop is halfway decent there will be a lot (sometimes far too much) of material one would have to work into the ground to be naturally broken down over the following years to put organic material back into the soil for future crops to draw nutrients from.  (And yes, I relize that sentence was a run-on like four times over...) sometimes one would have to clear it off with a stalk chopper and bale it, or drag it and burn the residue of there is far too much.  So short answer, yes, grazing cattle on corn stubble is beneficial both as basically free feed, and to rid the ground of excess material.

2mpf5c,1,Both really but honestly the tractor driver pulling the grain wagon should not have been that close to the harvester.  Its not like they did the entire field this way. They put the wagon behind the harvester to get around the powerline tower without having to run over crops.  They would normally be running parallel and staggered to you can actually see whats happening.,0,,,1,funny
