15ty52,1,"In the coming decades, continued population growth, rising meat and dairy consumption and expanding biofuel use will dramatically increase the pressure on global agriculture. Even as we face these future burdens, there have been scattered reports of yield stagnation in the world’s major cereal crops, including maize, rice and wheat. Here we study data from ~2.5 million census observations across the globe extending over the period 1961–2008. We examined the trends in crop yields for four key global crops: maize, rice, wheat and soybeans. Although yields continue to increase in many areas, we find that across 24–39% of maize-, rice-, wheat- and soybean-growing areas, yields either never improve, stagnate or collapse. This result underscores the challenge of meeting increasing global agricultural demands. New investments in underperforming regions, as well as strategies to continue increasing yields in the high-performing areas, are required.

The global demand for agricultural crops is expected to roughly double by 2050, driven by increases in population, meat and dairy consumption and biofuel use[1, 2, 3]. However, between 1985 and 2005, the total global crop production increased by only 28% (through a ~2.5% net expansion of global cropland area, an ~7% increase in the frequency of harvesting, and an average ~20% increase in crop yields per hectare)[4]. Clearly, these recent gains in global crop production fall short of the expected demands, leaving us with an important question: Which crops and which geographic regions offer the best hope of meeting projected demands, and where are improvements most needed?

Adding to this concern, some authors have suggested that yields for many important crops may be stagnating in some regions around the world[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In particular, there are concerns that yields may be stagnating or declining for three key crops—maize, rice and wheat—which together produce ~57% of the world’s agricultural calories[2]. A slowing, or worse, stagnation or collapse in the yield gains in these crops would have profound implications for the world food system.

Although some authors have already noted some specific local- or national-scale examples of where crop yields may have stagnated[5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12], no spatially detailed assessment of global crop yield trends has been attempted to date. To consider the current state and trends in yields of the world’s four key crops (maize, rice, wheat and soybean) that currently provide ~64% of agricultural calorie production[2], we employed new long-term and high-resolution geospatial databases of global agricultural systems[13], synthesized from ~2.5 million census observations (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Using these data, we analysed detailed spatial and temporal patterns of yields, determining where these four key crops have experienced yield stagnation and where crop yields are still increasing.

These new data give us a dramatically improved understanding of crop yield and area changes across regional and global scales, which are otherwise often obscured using only national census statistics[11]. For example, using only the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization’s national crop statistics[14] suggests that American wheat yields increased everywhere at ~0.01 tonsha^(−1) year^(−2) (0.3%/year) between 1999 and 2008. Using our new high-resolution geospatial data set, we were able to identify that yields in ~36% of the American wheat-harvested areas (~7 million ha) are not improving; only in the remaining ~64% of wheat land (~13 million ha) are yields improving, and at different identifiable rates.

Here we analyse changes in yields over time at each of the political units where maize, rice, wheat and soybean were harvested. We find that across 24–39% of maize, rice, wheat and soybean-growing areas, yields have either never improved, stagnated or collapsed. This result highlights the increasingly difficult challenge of meeting increasing global agricultural demands.",3,,,997,science

We found that global yield trends can be broadly divided into four types (Fig. 1). First, ‘yields never improved’—areas that have witnessed no significant yield improvements to date (Fig. 1a). Second, ‘yields stagnated’—areas where yields previously improved, but now are stagnating or declining (Fig. 1b). This category includes a range of yield trends post a year of yield maximum, including yields hovering near the yield maximum (that is, a yield plateau) and yield declines at various rates. Third, ‘yields collapsed’—areas where yields decreased since the 1960s, or initially increased and then collapsed to the 1960s level (Fig. 1c). Fourth, ‘yields still increasing’—areas where yields are still increasing (Fig. 1d). Based on recent rates of yield improvement, we can further divide this category into the top 25% of yield-improving regions—‘yields increasing rapidly’; the bottom 25% of yield-improving regions—‘yields increasing slowly’; and the intermediate 50% of yield-improving regions—‘yields increasing moderately’.

Overall, our analysis shows that most of the world has historically experienced significant yield improvements (Fig. 2, Table 1). The percentage of the world that never experienced any maize, rice, wheat or soybean yield improvement is small (~1% of each harvested crop areas; Table 1).

We find that the world’s maize, rice, wheat and soybean crops are continuing to experience yield increases in over 70, 63, 61 and 76% of their harvested areas, respectively—corresponding to 103, 96, 130 and 63 million hectares (m. ha) (Fig. 2; Table 1). Globally, however, rice (35%) and wheat (37%) have substantial areas that are now witnessing yield stagnation. Maize (26%) and soybean (23%) have less area in yield stagnation. Furthermore, we find that 3% of maize, 1% rice and 1% of wheat areas have experienced yield collapse.

Areas where yields are still increasing currently contribute roughly 79%, 57%, 56% and 82% of the total global production in maize, rice, wheat and soybean, respectively. The remainder comes primarily from regions witnessing yield stagnation. This then means that for wheat and rice, at least, yield stagnation may have profound implications on the ability of agriculture to meet the growing global demands for these commodities.

Below, we explore in more details the major regional patterns for these four crops. For statistical modelling used, model fits and classification used to determine yield trend category, please refer to the (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs S3–S5).

Regional summaries
Only ~1% of global maize areas never saw yield increases, and the significant areas were in Morocco and parts of India (0.4 m. ha) (Fig. 2a). Yields are stagnating in 26% of maize-harvested areas (Fig. 2a)—in the United States, generally on the fringes (for example, portions of the Great Plains) of the vast US Corn Belt (yields peaked mostly from mid 1990s, Supplementary Fig. S6), more widespread portions in eastern and southern Mexico (yields peaked mostly early 1990s) and in smaller areas of other major Latin American countries. In some parts of Western Europe, maize yield improvements have stagnated, especially, in Spain, Italy and Greece. Africa has a large extent of maize yield stagnation (yields here peaked mostly from the late 1990s). In Asia, in India and China, maize yields have stagnated across ~31 and ~52% of the maize-growing areas. Maize yields have collapsed in only 3% of global areas prominently in Dominican Republic, parts of northeast Brazil, Moldova, Africa (Chad, Rwanda, Angola, Zimbabwe and Lesotho) and South Asia (0.07 and 0.2 m. ha in India and Nepal, respectively). Maize yields are still increasing in 70% of global areas: in the vast United States Corn Belt, western and central Mexico, and most of Brazil and Argentina. Many other European, African and Asian maize areas are also witnessing steady maize yield improvement. The fastest maize yield improvements globally were found in the Corn Belt of the United States (~37% of all maize-harvested areas) and in Latin America, especially Argentina (78% of all maize-harvested areas), and Brazil. There are also some isolated similar fast increasing areas in Portugal, France, Eastern Europe, Turkey, Nigeria, South Africa, Pakistan, India, China, Vietnam and Indonesia. In most of the United States and Western Europe, maize yields are improving at either fast or moderate rates.

Only ~1% of the global rice-growing areas never saw yield increases; these areas were found in parts of Brazil (northeast Brazil), Greece, Mexico and India, as well as in Gabon, Gambia, Democratic Republic of Congo and North Korea (Fig. 2b). Rice yields are stagnating across 35% of rice-harvested areas globally: in the US state of California (yields peaked here in the late 1990s, Supplementary Fig. S6), parts of Latin America (Fig. 2b), most of Europe and parts of Africa (Fig. 2b). In Asia, the major rice-growing continent, yields are stagnating in China, India and Indonesia across 79%, 36% and 81% of rice-growing areas, respectively. Rice yield have collapsed in 1% of the world’s rice-harvested areas. The largest areas of rice-yield collapse were in Brazil (northeast Brazil), Sierra Leon and parts of Nigeria in Africa, Iraq and parts of India. Areas with ongoing rice-yield increases are found in all continents in 63% of global areas (except Australasia). However, large areas of rapidly increasing rice yields are found only in some countries: USA, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Spain, India, China, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

Wheat yields never improved in 1% of global areas: in large parts of the United States (~9% of its harvested areas), Argentina (~5%), Peru (~11%), Nigeria (100%), Lesotho (100%), Mongolia (~64%) and parts of Australia (~4%) (Fig. 2c). Wheat yields collapsed in an extremely small fraction of the world (~1% globally corresponding to 1.6 m. ha, out of which ~1.5 m. ha was in Australia). Yields are stagnating in 37% of global areas including ~27% of wheat areas in the United States (primarily in the Great Plain states where stagnation occurred after peaking mostly in the early to mid 1990s, Supplementary Fig. S6). Furthermore, wheat yields have been stagnating in parts of Argentina (~1.8 m. ha or ~34% of areas since the late 1990s) and almost everywhere in the highly productive wheat-growing areas of Western Europe as well as Eastern Europe. They are also stagnating in Turkey (in ~5.4 m. ha or ~64% of their wheat-growing areas), China (56% of areas) and India (in ~70% of areas). Wheat yields began stagnating in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan states of Pakistan (starting after ~2000), and in Australia, wheat yields are stagnating in ~44% of its areas. In all, 61% of global wheat areas are witnessing yield increases. Most of Canadian wheat areas, ~64% of United States wheat areas, Russian wheat, most African wheat areas, some areas of Asian wheat and ~40% of Australian wheat areas are still witnessing yield improvement. Although there are many countries with some fraction of their wheat areas witnessing rapid yield improvement, the countries with the top five spatial extent are (in m. ha): China (~8), Iran (~4), United States (~4), Afghanistan (~2) and India (~2).
 Soybean yields never improved in ~0.8 m. ha (1% of all global areas); these areas are concentrated in the United States (~0.4 m. ha), Argentina, Brazil and Mexico (Fig. 2d). Soybean yields collapsed in an insignificantly small area globally (0.2% of global areas). Brazil had a large area of soybean yield collapse (~0.1 m. ha), as did smaller areas in Uruguay and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Globally, soybean yield stagnation covers ~19 m. ha (~23% of harvested areas), and countries with more than a million ha in yield stagnation are (in decreasing order): China, India, United States, Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. Yield improvements are also fairly widespread but are more prevalent (~76% of global areas); countries with the largest spatial extent of yield improvements (again listed in decreasing order and more than a million ha each) are: United States, Brazil, Argentina, China and India.

15ty52,3,"Discussion:

Today, a global food crisis is looming as the world population increases, more people shift towards meat and dairy intensive diets and more cropland is diverted to grow biofuel crops[1, 2, 3, 4]. How will we meet these growing demands, especially when recent crop-production trends were insufficient to do so, and many regions are showing significant stagnation and declines in yield improvement?

Looking forward, we must first ensure that areas still increasing yields do not falter, while at the same time improving management practices to reduce impacts on the environment[4]. Next, we have to identify why yield gains for our most important cereal crops are stagnating in more than a quarter of our croplands. Can we reverse the yield stagnation in these areas? At the field to country scale, there are numerous studies showing that both biophysical and socio-economic causes, often not mutually exclusive, are the drivers of these yield changes. The lack of readily available data regarding all possible drivers of global agriculture at the level of our analysis precludes any effort to ascribe the causes behind the observed yield trends. However, below we discuss some of the reported field to country-scale causes of yield changes with an emphasis on Europe, Asia-Australasia and Africa; these are the continents where yield stagnation appears particularly widespread (Fig. 2).

In the Americas, maize yield stagnation is especially widespread only in Mexico. Here reduced fallow periods in areas of shifting cultivation without concomitant adoption of modern management practices[15], or non-introduction/adoption of non-local but high-yielding maize seeds by farmers[16], may be responsible. In the United States, greater adoption of no-till practice by farmers in the semi-arid areas of the Great Plains has coincided with intensified crop rotations[17] (for example, wheat-maize rotations as opposed to a fallow following wheat). Farmer net incomes may have consequently increased, but intensified crop rotations may have also led to increased yield variability and crop failures[17] in an area of already limited water resources[18]. Our analysis shows widespread yield stagnation in these regions, especially for wheat (Fig. 2a and c).

In Europe, wheat yields may have declined because of climate changes in some countries of Western Europe[10], though elsewhere in more northern countries, the warmer climate may have led to fewer low yield years, and even expansion of wheat areas[14, 19]. Elsewhere in Europe, warmer temperatures may have had no effect on boosting either maize and wheat yields[20]. Confounding the climate-change effects in Europe are socio-economic and policy decisions to reduce farmer remuneration for intensive cultivation, or to reduce the environmental burden[6, 7, 10, 21, 22], which may have reduced farmer inputs leading to yield stagnation11 but improved environmental quality[23]. However, there are clearly both regional/country and crop specificities. There may now be fewer incentives to boost wheat yields in Western European countries11 (namely in France, Germany and United Kingdom), which correlates with our results showing widespread areas where yield increases have ceased (~80% of the wheat areas in France and Germany, and ~99% in the United Kingdom). However, maize yields are increasing almost everywhere in France and Germany (~90% and 100% of maize-growing areas, respectively). Spain, Portugal and Italy on the other hand have a larger fraction of their wheat areas showing yield increases (82%, 89%, and 76%, respectively) compared with maize (48%, 65%, and 41%, respectively).

In Asia and Australia, yields of wheat and rice may have stagnated as shown in our analysis (see Fig. 2b) due to a combination of factors that are location-specific, including climate-change-related heat stress[24, 25], increased night time temperatures[26], depletion of soil fertility and salinization[12, 27], soil erosion[27], increasing competition for water resources[28], pest and disease build-up[27] and a lack of capital[29] to buy more expensive inputs while the real crop prices declined[30]. Wheat yields may have stagnated in Bangladesh[31], and in parts of India also because of current cultivars approaching their yield potentials[32]. The effect of water scarcity for irrigation, falling groundwater water tables[18, 27, 33] and soil-quality depletion may be even more pronounced for rice[34, 35], leading to the widespread rice-yield stagnation (Fig. 2b). The need for new wheat cultivars is another major challenge; specifically, varieties are needed that are heat- and water logging-tolerant for growing conditions in South Asia where wheat follows rice in the crop rotation, and frost-tolerant varieties for the growing conditions in East Asia[27]. Similarly, rice cultivars that provide high yields in nutrient-deficient soils[36] are needed to boost yields. Changing the length and type of crop rotation with better management could also boost Asian rice and wheat yields[37].

In Africa, crop yields may have stagnated due to a complex combination of factors, many of which may ultimately be due to socio-economic limitation. Specific constraints to crop yield increases include variability of dry spells and lack of field-water management strategies in the drier parts of the continent[38], absence of significant irrigation infrastructure[39, 40], low nutrient application and absence of fallows to restore soil fertility levels[41, 42], lack of availability of suitable high-yielding crop varieties that in turn could be related to institutional and political conditions[42, 43, 44], and the lack of farmer expertise in appropriate agronomic practices[42]. However, when combinations of socio-economic factors align to overcome the biophysical limitations, significant yields gains are achieved[45]. For example, landscape-scale modelling results[39], field trials[46] and policy experiments[47], all demonstrate that fairly small increase in inputs is sufficient to double maize yields in Africa.

Although we have found widespread yield stagnation, an increase in the number of crops per cropping cycle or intercropping with other crops[48, 49, 50] can increase net food supply and farmer incomes[17]. Indeed, global harvested areas have increased at nearly three times the rate of global croplands areas since 1985[4]. In some areas, farmers may have prioritized livestock over grain crops, and in other regions, yields may have stagnated, but the total factor productivity (the ratio of the total output to the total input) increased[21, 51]. However, globally, there remain many regions where both the growth in yields and total factor productivity of agriculture remain low, perhaps because of a lack of established agricultural research and investment[51].

At the global scale, yields are being affected by both biophysical[52, 53] and socioeconomic[22, 29, 40] factors. Differences in crop performance create yield gaps[4, 5, 32, 39] that could be overcome by adoption of best management practices[54, 55, 39]. Understanding how changes to management practices (including fertilizer application, irrigation, pest management and others) could close yield gaps[39] is critical to addressing stagnating yields on our most important croplands. Failure to identify and alleviate causes of yield stagnation, collapse and never improving yields will have an impact on the future of global food security.

Our global analysis shows that maize, rice, wheat and soybean crops are continuing to experience yield increases in 61–76% of their global harvested areas. This implies that between 24–39% of these cropland areas are no longer witnessing yield increases; the spatial extent of such rice and wheat areas is now particularly extensive (37% and 39% of global areas, respectively). In all, 43% of global rice and 44% of global wheat production are currently from these areas, not witnessing yield increases, raising the important question of how future demands, at least in these two commodities, would be met.

More troubling is our finding that for the top-three global rice producers–China, India and Indonesia, yield gains are not occurring across 79%, 37% and 81% of their rice cropland areas. China, India and the United States–the top-three wheat producers–similarly are not witnessing yield increases in 56%, 70%, and 36% of their wheat cropland areas, respectively. The spatial extent for the top-three global producers of soybean under these yield conditions is much lower, but China, the second largest global maize producer, now has more than half its area not witnessing yield gains (Table 1). China and India, the world’s two most populous countries[3], are now hotspots of yield stagnation with more than a third of their maize, rice, wheat and soybean areas not witnessing yield improvement with the problem being more acute in China. For some crops in these two countries, the spatial extent of yield stagnation is more than half the cropped area.

It is thus quite clear from these results that considerable investment in agriculture is needed in the coming decades to meet the challenges of the growing demand for food; simultaneously, we have to maintain a livable environment[4]. Although this study suggests that we have been losing ground on maintaining growth in agricultural production, there are promising paths to pursue in the years ahead[56].

15ty52,6,"Well, it's pretty easy to see some possible problems with this.  To start with, they begin their study right when the green revolution, begun in the 1940s, was really going in earnest.  Basically massive growth in agriculture in much of the world.

The second wave began when the US realized the vast majority of export grain was only being grown in four countries, so the USDA began a massive hybridization program to create grains that could grow in less ideal agricultural lands.  

Giant agribusiness concerns, like Monsanto, took over from this and innovated much bigger yields, disease and insect resistance, and far more effective pesticides.  All of this caused vast increases and stabilization in the amount of food around the world in fits and starts.

However, stresses to agriculture started appearing as well, such as ground salinization, aquifer depletion, the need for a much better fertilizer slurry pipeline system (think oil pipelines but carrying fertilizer over hundreds of miles in networks of large pipes.)

Agriculture also was tied up with giant national bureaucracies, which tried to control wild market forces by pumping huge subsidies at all levels of production.

Today, in the US, the immense size of agribusiness is such that it takes a close second to the military-industrial complex in scale.  To make projections of the future at the planetary scale is problematic at best.

In the US, the congress could overnight cause a huge overabundance of corn just by suspending the federal demand for fuel ethanol production.  If this was done abruptly, the price of corn around the world would crash, to avoid this we would probably have to destroy vast amounts of corn, or it would screw up a bunch of agricultural industries, from animal food, beef, chicken, pork, milk, processed food, etc.",0,,,13,science

Wheat was sitting on the ground rotting because there were not enough grain wagons to transport it from the fields. Sylos were not big enough to hold so much. 

This year U.S. and Ukraine kind of wend down. There were stupid freezes in southern Ukraine, and some stupid weather in U.S., killing up to 40% 2012-2013 crops in Ukraine. Now (Jan. 2013) wheat prices are really high, like 50-70% higher than 5-year average. 

Grains are a funny business. And biggest problem is not yields (it never has been). It's mostly storage and transportation.

Ok-ish price source is [IGC](http://www.igc.int/en/grainsupdate/igcgoi.aspx). Price goes up = less grain available, price goes down = more grain available. 

As for capacity, just think about this. Assuming ideal circumstances, in order to export 30 mil tonnes of grain in one month from Russia, you need 30mil/60/30*2~33000 wagons doing one return trip in 2 days. Which is about as fast as they can go. Russia has 5200 wagons of its own. And only two existing wagon factories produce 80 new wagons a year combined. Rest is rented from Eastern Europe at very high rates, which simply adds to the price. 

If only Russia had a huge proper factory (like the one Brazil has), they could either double capacity or half the price. But nobody is willing to invest ~$1.2 bil into a 20 year project to fix this. Because fuck grain, you can build a small nuclear power plant in the same timespan and for same money. ",0,,,5,science

This included weighing the relative importance of land costs, labor costs, nutrient cost/availability, the proximity of equipment dealers/repairs, etc.  I was able to get on the phone with everyone from seed developers to farmers and grain traders before essentially giving up.  It's amazing just how limited the data is for this kind of study.  Controlling for the styles, intensity, sophistication, not to mention cost of farming the same crop in various places around the world is probably impossible.  There isn't a standard candle, so to speak, for agricultural yield.  Even wheat, which is literally grown everywhere, isn't effective, as different grades of wheat, different positions in rotations, different nutrient intensities, can all dramatically influence yield.  The USDA, for all of its faults, is pretty unique in the breadth and depth of the data it offers.

It may be of some consolation, however, to know that folks are constantly purchasing and improving farming operations all over the developing world.  Soybean yields in southern Minnesota might be stagnating, but there's a ton of room to run with Romanian or Serbian wheat, for example.  Some of the best soil in the world (relevant username) is producing less than half of what we're pulling out of mediocre soil in parts of the US.

Like I said, (for grain at least) we've always hit the limit on the amount of food we can transport and store. So subsidising ethanol to the extent we have has encouraged farmers to use surplus corn which cannot be used for food (have no effect on food prices).

Subsidising ethanol to the extent that trading corn returns less profit than trading ethanol would presumably cause farmers to produce ethanol *over* corn. You'd have to subsidise an extreme amount to have this be the case (ethanol costs roughly two dollars a gallon to produce at a decent yield using lots of feedstock, then there's a much higher cost in energy, equipment, storage and distribution).

We don't have any accurate research (nothing beyond some very assumptive models) on the topic so we can't really know whether this is the case, or in general how ethanol subsidies affect food prices.

15ty52,7,"The population increases BECAUSE of the increased food supply, not DESPITE of it. It's impossible to maintain constant growth in food supply or population size. For example, even if you take a seemingly benign growth rate of 3.5% a year, and have the population of the world increase at that rate for a 100 years, it would mean that at the end of that period you would have 8x more people living than when you started. If we take our present world population of cca. 7.5 billion it would mean that at that rate of growth Earth would be populated by 37,5 billion people. So it's obvious why that's impossible - we would all die of hunger! But economy and the ecosphere are selfregulating systems. More people means higher pressure on the food production industry. If it can't deliver, then people will have to pay more for food because the demand has increased but the supply has not followed. That means it will become more profitable to produce food, so either new technologies will be discovered to capitalize on this, or people will simply stop reproducing as quickly because they can hardly afford to feed themselves, let alone their children. So that creates another pressure that drives birth rates down or into the negative. The point is, no one needs to starve for this to happen. These are all long term trends and the system balances itself. Only a huge disaster like a major world war or a major natural catastrophe can tip the scales from slow adjustment through market forces to mass starvation.

15ty52,2,"I am familiar with Pollan's work and must confess his writing has an enormous influence on my switch from industrial style agriculture to sustainable.  I think one of the examples Pollan gives in AOD is the measurement of ""yield"" of specific location.  In measuring rice produced in a specific paddy the other products of the ecosystem are neglected.  They measure the rice but do not measure the other products that can be consumed from the environment of the paddy.  Spraying the paddy to keep other products from thriving is not the true value of the ecosystem.  Personal example: We grow oats for chickens and pigs on the farm.  We used to till, spray, harvest, spray, till, and plant back grass seed.  This process takes two whole years.  The oat yield for the harvest year was phenomenal.  The field was tilled again in fall and seeded back in spring keeping furrows upturned throughout the bitter winters and subject to wind and rain/snow erosion.  Now I till in the spring, plant oats with grass seed at the same time.  I do not spray and harvest oats in late summer then graze cows on the land in the late fall or early winter.  Now, the oat yield is much smaller than the sprayed oat yield however ground exposure to the elements is two weeks at most in one spring.  There is value in keeping your top soil on your farm as well as value in the weight the cattle gain grazing new seeding in the winter.  We try to make sure the ground is frozen before we run cattle across newly seeded fields.  If we are measuring land value on yield then absolutely, on paper, we would want to till the land and use a two year cycle on oats.  It would be a ""common sense"" move but we need to measure ecosystems, not just one aspect of a multi-faceted system.  Keep in mind the grains should not be going to herbivores.  Next spring I am going to do a two acre trial of pasture cropping that is being done in Australia.

This is an area that doesn't receive consistent rain, and too many farmers (including my brother-in-law) are far too eager to jump on the tractor and start ploughing the soil any time it rains. 

Most of the farming in this area is combined grazing stock and grain, and the habit of over-tilling leads to powdery soils that have no structure, hold less water, and set like concrete when a small downpour occurs, allowing the Australian heat to bake the surface and kill off a lot of the ground cover.

I know its anecdotal, but my father and uncle have improved their farming techniques over the last 20 years or so, with minimum-till farming, which works well for them due to the nature of their farm (sheep and cereal grains) and soil type. They still have to till the soil due to compaction from grazing stock; but throwing away the disc plough and combine seeder; making light use of the scarifier; buying a spray rig, tine ripper, scaribar with press wheels and an air-seeder has allowed the clay-type soil to retain moisture in years when the rain doesn't come as often, which has increased yields in bad years as well as good. They were stripping reasonably-yielding crops in years when many around them didn't bother because it would cost more to harvest than what they would make by selling the grain.

I was shocked when I read that. (Source: http://www.naturalnews.com/033925_organic_farming_crop_yields.html)

So it's not a question of ""organic farming"" being inferior (regarding crop yield). In reality, using fewer chemicals does NOT diminish crop sizes in the long run (as we've all been led to believe). Giant agri-businesses are dealing with problems of their own. They've sprayed the crap out of weeds and slathered the pesticides on. The problem? Weeds develop a resistance to the chemicals. Insects seem to evolve immunities to the pesticides. So they end up spraying them with 3 times as many chemicals as they used to even ten years ago. And the result is crop sizes that are about the same.

So you're getting three times the chemicals and toxins on your food. And it's not producing larger yields.

(There's also growing evidence that the chemicals used by giant agri-businesses actually hurt the soil. So the global drop in crop yields may have absolutely nothing to do with organic farming. Quite the contrary. Giant agri-businesses are polluting the soil and damaging the environment. See: Bee colony collapse studies which link bee devastation to chemicals like Round-Up. Without bees, certain plants aren't pollinated and certain crops cease to thrive. http://naturalsociety.com/monsanto-bee-collapse-buys-bee-research-firm/) So the global drop in crop yields may in fact be a result of agri-businesses like Monsanto cornering the world market with their products and techniques.",0,,,-8,science

The resistances are not the fault of the chemicals but the fault of the user using the chemicals like a fucking idiot, it can all be avoided by simply using several chemicals and limit the frequency, now add some crop rotation (which is pretty standard) and tada! 

The whole bee collapse is a little bit more complicated then that. France and Germany already have banned some of the pesticides who are believed to be a factor in this. (because you know one chemical is not the other) 

Oh and organic farmers spray chemicals as well, extracted from natural sources that is, but that doesn't mean it is any better for the environment.

As for yields? for most crops organic agriculture produces less, a study from England suggests that it's 50% less there. Crops such as carrots are usually grown quite organically by organic farmers as well as conventional farmers due to the lack of effective chemicals that are allowed.

I am not familiar with this Rodale institute, however I am extremely skeptical of their methodology and results. In no published study in a credible journal, has organic production ever out-yielded conventional. 
In this article they claim the reason they got these results was they have been doing this study over a long period of time. I have personal seen organic production of several farms since the 1980s that are surrounded by conventional farms. The yields on the organic farms have never been higher and rarely close to the yields on the conventional farms. The only way to achieve results that the did that I can think of is not use fertilizer on any of the treatments, except those given manure. They do not mention applying fertilizer to any of the treatments (which would be done in all cases of non-organic production), so I suspect that was the case.

The article also claims that organic production uses less fossil fuels, which is untrue. In order to produce field crops organically at least 3-4 tillage operations (which requires substantial amounts of fuel) are required per year. In no-till systems, the seed is sliced into the soil and the field is sprayed 2-5 times per year. Both these operations require much less fuel than tilling the soil. Tilling the field is the single worst thing for the soil commonly done in farming. The soil is a living thing that does not enjoy being disturbed. In no-till systems the ground is not really tilled, however seeding does disturb the soil somewhat, which leaves the soil aggregates in tact.

Your summary of weed and pest resistance is an oversimplification. Yes, resistance does happen, but it takes a long time. It's actually the farmers and policy makers fault for pest resistance. Farmers in the past have no been responsible with their use of chemicals, but they are improving. This should help on the environmental issue as well. Policy makers need to see that putting subsidies on things like ethanol have trickle-down effects that affect more than the price of corn. Because the price of corn is higher, farmers are willing to spend more on their crop to make more money, which unfortunately means more pesticide use.

But data compiled by the Rodale Institute's Farming Systems Trial (FST) shows that quite the opposite is true -- in every single category, organic farming systems proved to be far more viable and sustainable than any conventional or GM system.

Initiated back in 1981, Rodale's FST is the longest running, side-by-side comparison of organic and chemical agriculture that has ever been conducted in the US. Researchers from the institute have been carefully examining the similarities and differences between the two systems for over 30 years and, much to the shock of the mainstream food community, have found that organic farming is far superior to chemical farming in every way.

In the short term, organic yields appeared to be smaller than chemical-based yields. But over time, organic yields eventually caught up to, and even exceeded, chemical-based yields. Organic production also proved to be more profitable to farmers than chemical-based production because it requires significantly less energy input, representing a nearly 50 percent reduction over chemical-based farming.""

In addition to important findings on overall environmental health, their use of intercropping techniques found that this method of non-monocrop agriculture leads to overyielding in many instances.  So while a monocrop of canola means more overall canola per acre, the canola-pea intercrop (the one that overyielded the most) led to a higher land equivalency ratio than monocrops.

I think there's some pretty good evidence that monocrops produce more per acre of a single food source (e.g. wheat) than organic/natural farming methods in a short period of time, but intercropping and other organic techniques can lead to higher overall yields of food in that is sustainably produced (i.e. less fossil fuel inputs, better long-term soil health, reduced negative environmental impacts).

15ty52,0,"You have three main factors in play. 

* **First**, the marginal land added to production is of low quality, so its yield potential is also low. 

* **Second**, input costs have risen and farmers are now concerned to maximise profit and not production, meaning where marginal cost crosses marginal revenue. The old days of ""chucking on all the nitrogen she'll stand"" are very much over: you put on enough so that the incremental yield just covers the cost of doing so. Very sophisticated farmers use more or less real time satellite imagery to dress and treat to a 10m accuracy, given the inhomogeneity of the soil in any one field. 

* The **third factor** is the most important. The slack has been taken up in conventional plant improvement. Maize and wheat now put half of all of their dry matter into the ear, versus a few percent with unselected strains.  The ear does not shatter during harvest. Combines pick up all but a few percent of the grain. Stems are short and stout to support huge ears. Roots have been selected to to penetrate deep for long, slow water extraction at night and shallow to hold the plant up and grab whatever surface water falls, to kill weeds. Pest and disease resistance in universal. The eg baking quality of the starch has been enhanced. 

That brings us to the **unconventional tools**: much better water use, both in irrigation and in-plant; salt tolerance, enhanced pest resistance, perennial crops, crops that are symbiotic with nutrient harvesting fungi; and so on. Much of this requires non-conventional breeding, which face a headwind of objection that is passionate in direct proportion to its being nonsensical. 

There are **further non-conventional tools** that can be deployed. Perhaps 1% of the world's surface area is farmed at high capital and technical intensity. Peasant farming continues in ways unchanged save for occasional access to pesticides, better varieties and crude fertilisers. More integrated production techniques - not necessarily capital intensive, but usually so - will follow. It would be socially a good thing if the unconventional tools I mentioned above percolated down to village level, and enabled small farmers to prosper against this trend, which invariably involved land consolidation. (For example, small scale biomass power generation based on stover waste and purpose grown perennial crops.)

The plain fact is that humanity does not ""need"" 9 billion. Note that *intensification is almost always working ""against"" biodiversity*: we collect more grain, so birds get less; we kill weds, so bugs have nothing to feed on. However, we are going to get 9 billion unless there is a die back, and so we also need intensive efforts to preserve biodiversity. In broad terms, we had an area the size of Australia under cultivation in 1900, an area the sixe of Siberia plus China farmed in 2000 and we will have an area of green wilderness, globally, the size of Australia in 2030. If we go made for biofuels, even that may be trimmed. ",0,,,1,science
