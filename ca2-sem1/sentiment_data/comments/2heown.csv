2heown,0,"I'm an Iowa farmer. Crop yields are literally my life's work. Let me clear up some misconceptions I see floating around here (edit: here being Reddit, not the project itself)...

1) EVERYONE in agriculture is already well aware of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legume roots. This is old, old information, the kind of thing you learn in Agronomy 101. It's the biggest reason that crop rotation has been a wonderful tool for millennia.

2) Cereal crops such as wheat and corn are very nitrogen-hungry. Even in rotation with legumes, we still must add a LOT of supplemental nitrogen to our soil to get the crop's full potential (which has increased dramatically over the last century). Bacterial sources alone aren't up to the task any more, but every bit of N they produce is a little less fertilizer we have to buy.
 
3) The idea of ""Why don't we take a legume's nitrogen-fixing bacteria and put them in the cereal crop?"" is as old as our understanding of rhizobia's role in nitrogen production. Not much practical success to date.

4) We regularly use soil inoculants to increase the soil's population of helpful bacteria and fungi. Not news.

5) The interesting stuff to me in their project is about how the rhizobia affect germination. I'd love to see some side-by-side tests in a more real-world scenario; we've already got a number of germination boosting seed treatments which would be interesting in comparison.",1,,,2445,worldnews

2. The ""pumped up"" teen(s) is/are given unrealistic expectations.

3. Inevitable conspiracy theories about why this ""new technology"" is not in use because Monsanto is evil and keeps people down for profit.

2heown,5,"The Irish were forced to subsist on potatoes during the [Great Famine](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_potato_famine#Genocide_question) because the British were intent on destroying them through starvation:

>Throughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food. In Ireland before and after the famine, Cormac O'Grada points out, ""Although the potato crop failed, the country was still producing and exporting more than enough grain crops to feed the population. But that was a 'money crop' and not a 'food crop' and could not be interfered with.""[82] Up to 75 percent of Irish soil was devoted to wheat, oats, barley and other crops that were grown for export and shipped abroad while the people starved.

>In History Ireland magazine (1997, issue 5, pp. 32â€“36), Christine Kinealy, a Great Hunger scholar, lecturer, and Drew University professor, relates her findings: Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women and children died of starvation and related diseases. She also writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock (except pigs), bacon and ham actually increased during the Famine. This food was shipped under British military guard from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland; Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee and Westport. A wide variety of commodities left Ireland during 1847, including peas, beans, onions, rabbits, salmon, oysters, herring, lard, honey, tongues, animal skins, rags, shoes, soap, glue and seed. The most shocking export figures concern butter. Butter was shipped in firkins, each one holding 9 gallons. In the first nine months of 1847, 56,557 firkins were exported from Ireland to Bristol, and 34,852 firkins were shipped to Liverpool which correlates to 822,681 gallons of butter exported to England from Ireland during nine months of the worst year of the Famine.[83] The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.[84]

>In 1996, Francis A. Boyle, a law professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote a report commissioned by the New York-based Irish Famine/Genocide Committee, which concluded that the British government deliberately pursued a race and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the group commonly known as the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the Hague convention of 1948.[fn 7]

2heown,6,"Hmmm, I can't say I agree with your reading of this information. 

I'm sure the British didn't care too much about the Irish as a people - there's a well documented history of that - but to say that it was the intent of the British to destroy the Irish through starvation seems factually wrong and implausible.  The article even says that the exported crops were cash crops, meaning that the Irish hadn't been subsisting on them before the famine, which should be obvious anyway.

Further evidence suggests that British response (or lack thereof) was economic in nature: 

>The measures undertaken by Peel's successor, Russell, proved comparatively ""inadequate"" as the crisis deepened. The new Whig administration, influenced by the doctrine of laissez-faire,^[71] believed that the market would provide the food needed and refused to intervene against food exports to England, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.^[72]

>So, the famine itself was precipitated by British actions (leading to, most importantly, Potato Dependency) and catalyzed by the blight, but it wouldn't make sense for the British to try to starve out people who were so economically beneficial. 

It wasn't the people who were economically beneficial, it was the land.    The people were mostly useless to the British and were also not pro-British.    It was very politically expedient to just let them starve.  

The potato crops failed everywhere in Europe and the United States, but only the Irish starved because the British forced them to starve to death by removing all the other crops that did not fail.  All this happened 'at gunpoint' since the British had troops guarding the food to be exported.  

During an earlier famine in 1782-1783, the British had closed the ports and retained the food grown in Ireland to feed the people there, but this time the British reversed that policy and forced the Irish to starve to death instead.  

From Wikipedia

>This criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: ""I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.""[145] Also in 1849 the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all rateable properties in Ireland.[146] Twisleton testified that ""comparatively trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation."" According to Peter Gray, in his book The Irish Famine, the government spent Â£7,000,000 for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, ""representing less than half of one percent of the British gross national product over five years. Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the 20 million pounds compensation given to West Indian slave-owners in the 1830s.""[113]",0,,,2,worldnews

A law professor commissioned by people who want to prove it was genocide writes a paper about it being genocide (shocking)

>Historian Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da disagreed that the famine was genocide: first, that ""genocide includes murderous intent, and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish""; second, that most people in Whitehall ""hoped for better times for Ireland"" and third, that the claim of genocide overlooks ""the enormous challenge facing relief agencies, both central and local, public and private"".[159] Ã“ GrÃ¡da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.[159]

Problems:

* The conclusion implies that both strains of Rhizobacteria that were tested appear to have produced the positive results, but don't separate those results between the bacteria, nor do they give absolute averages for the controls.
* They don't identify the source of the soil or how they dealt with variation therein
* If they published their raw data, I don't see it.  The test protocols were modified mid-test; because the raw data was not published, I can neither validate their statistical analysis nor tell whether the pre-redesign values were included.  Even if so, it would mean that particularly high-performers would get excluded, skewing the results (albeit in the negative direction).

None of these are study-killers, but they should be addressed.

Recommendations:

* Cast a wider net: add groups for other strains of rhizobacteria and other nitrogen fixing and non-fixing strains from unrelated species.  Is the positive result from a symbiotic relationship unrelated to nitrogen?  Is it from something particular to these species of rhizobacteria?

2heown,1,"I have never posted on here before however I feel I need to voice my opinion on this thread.

I am quite aware of this project as I have seen the girls give a presentation on their work quite recently and have read the entirety of their online report (which no doubt many here have not). I wish to clear up some of the points that have been raised about their research.

Never have the students claimed that this is completely original research, they have clearly known that there has been many investigations into increasing crop yields with bacterial aids. What is unique about the girls work is it is by far the most conclusive and comprehensive study into the effects of nitrogenous bacteria on the germination of cereal crops. No study this extensive on this particular sub section of a plants growth cycle has been carried out to date as far as I am aware. Yes, their work later looked at crop yields as an add on investigation (which has been done by others in the field) and the media seem to have sensationalised that aspect of their research as I am sure many other academics have had experience of. The key point to note is that the majority of their efforts were focused on the germination stage.

Also what is unique is the sheer volume and thoroughness of the analysis. As an academic myself their work is certainly to the level of research Masters proposal if not even higher. Were all their experiments carried out in a controlled setting and so would stand up to thorough scientific scrutiny? No, the project was done in their kitchen, spare bedroom and garden. But they are 16 - and quite simply did not have access to those facilities so that should not be held against them.

In two and a half years they have analysed over 12,000 seeds. This involved taking 130,000 manual measurements, which for the germination experiments meant individually inspecting each seed for signs of germination every 6 hours. To account for personal bias they blinded all their experiments so as to ensure completely accurate recording of results. To further their experimentation they completed an enzyme analysis of seeds at different stages of the germination process to understand the molecular mechanisms taking place.

With the sheer amount of data collected, the results the girls presented could be taken to be quite conclusive without extensive analysis. However they did not rely on sheer data set size to verify their results. They conducted a full statistical analysis of their data using Student-t test, Dunnett test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for parameteric data and Kolmogorow-Smirnoff and Shapiro-Wilkes Tests for non-parametric data. I have quizzed them on the use of these tests because I find it improbable that 16 year olds can fully understand such high end statistics. It is clear that one of trio is the maths wizz and the other two probably dont fully understand the nuances of the analysis. However the staistics expert (Ciara) of the group can manually demonstrate the mathematics involved in the analysis and explain it better than I can myself.

Will this project ""change the world"" as google keeps stating? Probably not. Just like many other fine pieces of research (whether completed by teenagers, PhD students or academics) which initially seem so promising eventually fade away. But what I imagine has been recognised by the judges at Google, the EU Contest for Young Scientist and the Irish national science competitions (both of which the girls won in 2013) is the sheer strength and solidity of the scientific approach taken by three 16 year old girls which is more than befitting of any research thesis.",0,,,2,worldnews

Planting corn on corn, year after year depletes all the nitrogen in the soil and eventually produces basically nothing.

It also has some soil-building and pest/disease management benefits (basically just reducing the disease population in off years since different pests affect the two different crops), but those are secondary in my mind.",0,,,5,worldnews

2heown,2,"Yes, I'm familiar with permaculture, at least in general principles (everything self-sustaining, modeled on natural ecosystems, integrating architecture with agriculture). And you're correct, it's very different than agriculture as practiced on the majority of acres in Iowa.

It's an interesting idea, and one that has the potential to improve agriculture around the world, especially in places with marginal soil (unlike most of Iowa). There are lessons to be learned.

However, I've got three main problems with it:

1) It's largely based on an [appeal to nature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature). We may simply disagree on this point.

2) It ignores the significant sustainability/ecological efforts practiced by more mainstream agriculture. I spend more money per year on various ecological improvement efforts than all but the largest permaculture practitioners. I genuinely care about my soil quality, my water quality, and the downsides & dangers of misuse of farm chemicals. My children live here; they eat (some) of the food I grow, they drink the water, they swim in the lakes. 

3) I don't think it's scalable. It might work for a couple million of us, but I don't think it's feasible for all 7,125,000,000 of us. There's just not enough rural land, and the efficiencies of scale practiced in modern agriculture are what make it possible for cities to exist.

Adding organic materials such as compost will help with the soil's water holding capacity, water infiltration, and structure.  Soil organic matter is a good thing.  Topdressing the area with sand will help improve the soil's texture, but this takes a long time and a lot of sand.  I think your main issue is the high clay content.  Clay is the smallest soil particle, which creates a lot of very small pores (i.e. micropores).  These small pores are able to hold water very tightly, and that tightly-held water is unavailable to plants (the soil's pull on the water is greater than what the plant can create).  You're adding sand because it is the largest soil particle.  Sand creates large pores (i.e. macropores).  Macropores are good for drainage but bad for holding water.  Productive soils will have a balance of micro and macropores.  Your clay soil has too many micropores and too few macropores.  A loamy soil has equal influences (not percentages) of sand, silt, and clay.  A loam's balance of micro and macropores gives it the greatest plant available water holding capacity.

2heown,0,"Their project was ""combating the world food crisis"". Their plan was to produce more food (using methods that are already known). 

The problem is that the world already produces far more food than is consumed, and any ""food shortage"" is just the result of political or distribution problems. Growing more food WILL NOT solve that.

This is similar to the whole ""Live Aid"" campaign back in the mid 80's. It was popular and made well-fed people feel better about themselves but did almost nothing to address the problem.

We collected tons and tons of food, flew it across the world to Ethiopia, and then it sat and rot in warehouses, undistributed, because the root cause of the famine was due to political problems, not food production issues. We raised tons of money but it was largely spent on weapons. If you feed a political problem you get a bigger political problem.
