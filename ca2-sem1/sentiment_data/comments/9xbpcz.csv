9xbpcz,0,Basically cover crops are a storage method for soil nutrients. Nitrates can easily wash out of the soil unlike other soil nutrients so cover crops store them until you till them into the soil which slowly releases those nitrates back into the soil which is ideal for your next cash crop. They also prevent soil erosion and improve soil organic matter which improves water retention and insect biodiversity. ,0,,,19,farming
9xbpcz,1,"I personally think that, among the effects you listed, the pumping of a lot of carbon through the cover crops' roots into the soil to feed microorganisms and create organic matter is probably the single most important impact of the practice. Successful cover crops reduce nitrogen requirements, increase yields, and significantly improve soil structure. It might not be the very first year you do it though. I'm surprised of the angle they used in the article where they are happy the cover crop ""didn't hurt yields"". That is basically a failure for me, as I expect better yields, and I'm surprised because this particular study doesn't match my observations. Still, many studies confirm what I observe.",0,,,11,farming
9xbpcz,2,Very true. But i guess their angle is to convert the nay sayers who think growing a crop will automatically remove nutrients from the soil. The difference is of course that the cover crop isnt harvested meaning the nutrients arnt going anywhere. Furthermore if your using a legume as a cover crop it actually fixes nitrogen so it should improve yield. Im guessing this study used rye or some other grass which is why yields weren't improved? ,0,,,3,farming
9xbpcz,3,"Yes, legumes can actually pump down a lot of nitrogen into the soil. From what I read, one of the mixtures they had had 3 species including hairy vetch, a legume. Not all legumes are created equal, but many are expensive... Of course. So it's tempting to dilute them with cheaper things like oats.",0,,,2,farming
9xbpcz,4,"Legumes don't ""pump"" nitrogen into the soil. Microbial symbiosis/fixation only benefits the legume. The C:N ratio of legume biomass averaging under 24:1 is where the nitrogen benefit comes from. C:N ratios of under 24:1 also reduce SOM, so you have to pick which one you need to build up. Decomposition of any plant material will either take Carbon or Nitrogen from the soil, and there is no way around it.",0,,,5,farming
9xbpcz,5,"It was just a manner of speech. But you are right.  But when nitrogen levels are lowered by decomposition of plant material above C:N 24, the nitrogen becomes part of (immobilized) by microorganisms, and may be mineralized again, or become organic matter.

Unless I needed the nitrogen very soon and wanted to avoid immobilization, as in, an organic farmer trying to fertilize next year's corn with a fall cover crop full of legumes, it seems like I would almost always prioritize having organic matter over immediate nitrogen. So a mixture of carbon rhizodeposition and some other plants fixing nitrogen seems logical. Immobilized nitrogen can become available again.",0,,,3,farming
9xbpcz,6,"> or become organic matter

Organic matter is more or less synonymous with Carbon in this context. Nitrogen will never, ever become Carbon. Nitrogen only adds to SOM in the sense that if there is a stover present with greater than 24:1 C:N, the additional nitrogen is required to break it down, leaving extra Carbon. It does not, in any circumstance, create organic matter. The point I'm trying to make is that nitrogen fixed by legumes is not available to plants other than that legume. It is fixed in the nodules by the rhizobium species for that plant, and when the legume no longer needs nitrogen, the symbiosis ends and nitrogen is no longer fixed. Any ""nitrogen credit"" from a legume that benefits a grass, for example, is solely from the excess nitrogen coming from the breakdown of the legume stover.",0,,,2,farming
9xbpcz,7,"Organic matter is not only carbon for me. It's a lot of carbon, but not only carbon. I don't define organic matter the same way you do. So I can't really go along with the rest. But then when I read what you say, I get this feeling like we're actually talking about different phenomena, and we're not really disagreeing.",0,,,1,farming
9xbpcz,8,"Right.  We're really not disagreeing. Basically, I don't buy into it when somebody says that a legume growing simultaneously with a grass will provide nitrogen to the grass. I think a legume cover crop during the off season probably could have potential benefits in the right climate, but I don't think it would do much of anything to intercrop legumes with a grass cash crop. You are completely right, though. Organic matter is definitely more than just Carbon from a practical sense, however when breaking it down into the basic chemistry of the reactions taking place, the other nutrients are essentially along for the ride. Carbon is the basis of any organic molecule, so that's the approach I was taking.",0,,,1,farming
9xbpcz,9,"Ah, yes, in the context of seeing a legume cover crop interseeded with a grass crop, both growing simultaneously, then no, the legume isn't bringing nitrogen to the grass sitting next to it. It's for future crops, for sure.

9xbpcz,0,"I'm no expert, but I do this in my raspberries. I grow pole beans in between to pull nitrates down into the soil, then include the leftovers in my worm bins.

Only problem is, you can't *kill* raspberries, so I have no clue how beneficial this is...or isn't.

9xbpcz,1,Its still beneficial. A lot of berry production uses grasses in the isles because they promote beneficial organisms.,0,,,2,farming
9xbpcz,0,I thought the original claim was that cover crops would increase yield or help save money and thus help profitability? Cover crops are starting to sound like a scam. ,0,,,-7,farming
9xbpcz,1,"They make a difference. They're much better for sustainability, and better for the earth. I've replaced petrochemical fertilizer with cover crop and compost and my yields are still comparable. That's no scam",0,,,7,farming
9xbpcz,2,How’s the cost and what do you grow?,0,,,3,farming
9xbpcz,3,"Cover crop seed ends up around 100 dollars an acre. I do a multiple species mix of radish, turnip, clover, peas, vetch, and sunflower. I definitely think I sow way more seed than I need to, still trying to figure out my ratios. I consulted local crop advisors and they referred me back to petrochemicals, they aren't much help. I am slowly working on transitioning to an organic system. A lot of our income comes from a hunting lease, so I have some money to play with when it comes to crop. I like to experiment, but I certainly don't have the stress of most farmers when it comes to yield. ",0,,,6,farming

9xbpcz,8,"Summer grazing is decided on by ease of access from our permanent rotational pasture, winter grazing has normally been planted following a forage crop,  but we had a blizzard around the time that we normal plant the peas and oats, so we went back to corn this year and will have to find something to fill that hole in our ration.

9xbpcz,6,"If you’re main income is a hunting lease, you’re barely paying the taxes and not making a living on the property. Not even close. I’d believe what you said about cover crops a lot more if you were harvesting 1000 acres of corn or 10tons/acre of hay or something that sounds like a real business. ",0,,,-5,farming
9xbpcz,7,Why the skepticism and judgement? How do you know what this person's finances look like? I bet to them it is a very real financial gain on a very real business. It's not up to you to arbitrarily define what a real farming business looks like.,0,,,3,farming
9xbpcz,8,He’s obviously lying and knows nothing. That’s why. Hunting leases are a good way to pay the taxes and have extra eyes on property during down times (especially for timberland) and try to get some utility out of parts of a property that are impossible/difficult to put in production. 300/acre hunting lease is a flat out lie.,0,,,-1,farming
9xbpcz,9,"I appreciate the response. I know nothing about hunting licenses until now but when it comes down to it, I think part of the problem in your argument is both your tone and your immediate accusations as opposed to inquiry and understanding. How do you know 100% he's lying? Right now you are going off of your gut and (unspoken) experience with very little rebuttal in fact. A tough argument to sell especially when I know that I am doing wild innovative things at my farm that people thing is unbelievable.

I think in general we as farmers are very under supported but it is absolutely crucial that we converse in a way that makes sense and supports each other. It's the only way we will get through the haul - if we ever do!

Anyways, cheers and thanks again for your time.",0,,,2,farming
9xbpcz,7,"The lease is way more valuable than the crop in our situation. Almost 30k a year just to hunt a couple days a week from October to February seems like good business to me. I'm only managing 100 acres, it's a mix of wildlife habitat and agriculture. After hunting season we harvest 20 acres of corn, we also have 20 acres in hay. It's more of a homestead than a standard farming operation. The lease money provides the investment for seed, compost, power, basic operating cost. What we make on harvest is reinvested into equipment, livestock, or infrastructure. In terms of what I would like to build as a business, I'm only just getting started. ",0,,,2,farming
