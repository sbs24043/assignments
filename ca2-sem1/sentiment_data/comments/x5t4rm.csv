Comparing Texas/ Oklahoma/ Kansas/ Colorado dryland wheat farming to that grown in a northern European climate with good rainfall isn't exactly fair. A good year in some of those states is 60bu wheat, where I farm in Canada we hope to hit at least 95 most years, and in Europe yields are often closer to that 120bu mark, purely based on the climate of that region.",0,,,111,farming

x5t4rm,5,"Changes year to year with the specifics of the farm bill. 

Some years favor corn growers, some years favor cotton, others favor nuts. 

Most subsidy a farmer ever sees is in crop insurance for poor yielding years based on an average of the middle three yields of the last five years. 

Farmers can then purchase supplementary insurance from private companies for wind, hail, and dry years and those companies, as I understand it, get subsidized whether they pay out to the farmer or not.

x5t4rm,5,"The subsidy is in the insurance.  And with out it two things would happen.  One, food prices would not necessarily sky rocket but they would definitely go higher.  In a drought like this year prices would definitely skyrocket.  Secondly, family farms would be swallowed into corporate farms very quickly.

x5t4rm,6,"Like 90%of the subsidies go to the top 10% of farms though, I agree with what you're saying and they do help small farms but disproportionately. If you think Midwest politicians give a shit about you I've got a bridge to sell ya.",0,,,-3,farming
x5t4rm,7,"I made no comment about politicians and I do agree whole heartedly they could give a damn about any of us.  But your using your info out of context.  The insurance subsidies are given out by the acre and by the crop.  Every year I turn in my acres for each crop I grow to the farm service agency (FSA).  I have an insurance basis not only on the crops I grow but if any crop that has been produced for any appreciable amount of time on my ground.  So for instance I’ll turn in my corn acres when they get all planted and FSA matches their maps with the maps I turn into my insurance agent. They make sure everything jives and at the end of the year I get a bill from my insurance company that is X amount of dollars less than the actual cost of insuring my crop.  The subsidy check is collected by the insurance company, not the farmer.  
The reason you can even use that info is consolidation.  One hell of a lot of farmers went out of business in the eighties because they had crop failures and were carrying loans with interests rates north of 15% and no crop insurance.  So they sold everything and big farmers got bigger.  Corporate farms, in the derogatory sense, got bigger and bought out the little people. So yea the biggest farmers in a round about way got most of the subsidies. Because they farm the most ground. But on a per acre basis they got the same that I did.",0,,,4,farming
x5t4rm,8,"Okay. So when I pick a random country in a random state. Haskell country in Kansas, and I see that Clawson Farms have *received* $10M in welfare/subsidies (the majority from corn). You suggest that's not an actual payment but an insurance break, but this says explicitly this is *payments received* and does not include crop insurance premium subsidies. So either you're not telling the full story or you should call the old man/lady Clawson and figure out how to milk the system harder. 

This also brings me full circle to my original point of why is there so much goddamn corn being grown. Haskell county Kansas gets 18 inches of precipitation a year, and much less than that in the last decade. Why are the clawsons growing a crop that needs so much water? Do you honestly think that without all these subsidies, that basically guarantee a profit, they'd be growing that much corn? That was the original point to this thread. There is a ton of risk growing crops like corn in western Kansas, the subsidies minimize or eliminate that risk. That's why corn is grown to the extent that it is in the US, at the detriment of the environment under the guise of the economy. 

I'm not anti-farmer. I 100% get that you need to make the decisions that are financially the best for your family. That's human nature, and I promise you I am sympathetic to those ends. But stop deluding yourself. You do what you do because the smartest decision is to take advantage of the farm welfare program. If those disappeared, you would 100% change the way you operate, full stop. Corn would be grown to meet demand, prices at the production and consumer ends would change and it would hurt most of us for awhile. But we, the modern world, need to acknowledge that a change is coming and stop pretending that everything always has and always will be fine. How much corn can you grow when the ogallalah is dry? What will people in the gulf do when enough algae blooms wipe out their industries? More welfare from me to you and them?",0,,,0,farming

x5t4rm,7,"No need for name calling here I can assure you I’m not delusional.  I do not intend to mislead at all, please accept my apologies.  There are direct payments in instances of drought or flood or similar catastrophic events.  To receive those payments you have to sign an affidavit that your gross adjusted income isn’t over $999,999 and there is a cap even on the total amount of disaster payments that any person or entity can receive and I want to say the cap, to my understanding, is $250,000.  Maybe your right I should see what I’m not doing to get the big money?  

To your big point, this much corn is grown because this much corn is used. 
There isn’t government bunkers of corn 5 mi deep in the ground where they keep the stuff they don’t use.  I can tell your not an idiot and I’m not trying to paint you in that light so please don’t take it that way when I say the economic web that corn and all grain production that is woven into it, is not that simple.  Your damn right western Kansas isn’t corn country.  It’s barely even crop country period.  Mother Nature has shown what the region will grow and it’s grass.  

Well that’s why we raise a shit load of cows there.  And the feedlots that you cannot possibly miss in western Kansas are there because the cows are there.  And the corn is there because the cows are there.  Because the crop is in demand.  You can’t feed wheat to cows in the same concentrations as corn.  The land won’t raise forages with out irrigation and that’s a precarious situation in it own right.  

So you touched on human nature and to me that’s usually why things are the way they are.  Try telling any one in McDonald’s they can only have a single patty Big Mac.  Freaking riots would ensue.  It’s why there aren’t any feedlots in Central Park NY no one wants to smell that.  So out on the plains is where they stay. With the corn.

x5t4rm,0,"I believe the current world record wheat yield was achieved in New Zealand.  Somewhere in the area of 250 bushels per acre. Wheat prefers a long cool filling season and I think the New Zealand crop was in the ground for 300+ days. As far as I know it wasn’t irrigated. 

Wheat tolerates drought better than most crops and as such it’s favoured on marginal lands. Where I live (Southern Ontario, Canada) our soils are highly productive and 110 to 120 bushels per acre are fairly normal. However, because of the cost of land here we really don’t grow it for profit but rather as part of a regular rotation towards crops of higher margins. We call it “poverty grass”. The benefits to the soil from growing a decent wheat crop pay back the following year in increased corn yields, usually in the area of 10%. For lands unsuitable for corn, soy or other edible beans wheat, barley, rye and other grass crops make more sense as land costs are lower and a lower yielding crop can still generate a profit. This, more than anything else, is likely why in general US and CDN wheat productivity is lower per acre. The bulk of the wheat crop is grown on less productive land for very pragmatic reasons. In Holland, if you want wheat in the rotation, if you’re going to have any shot at generating a profit you’re going to have to farm the hell out of it, thus irrigation and a shit tonne of Nitrogen, guaranteed.",0,,,26,farming

x5t4rm,1,"Not sure what you mean by that.  Some farming in Canada is very efficient.   It is worth noting a fair portion of farming in Canada is done on land that is quite frankly close to marginal.  High quality land - for example Southern Ontario, parts of the Ottawa Valley and some other places - mostly grows higher value crops such as Corn and Soybeans if a large enough acreage, and fruit & consumer crops if smaller or located close to an urban area.  As a farmer located in Southern Ontario indicated it is fairly normal to obtain yields in the 110-120 bu/acre and even sometimes 130+.

Apples, Pears, Peaches, Nectarines, Plums and many other types of tree fruit are grown in Canada.  But the climate is not generally conducive to citrus although it may be possible in some areas - it is winter that presents a difficulty to citrus trees - they are not cold tolerant.  I have no knowledge of cotton so I cannot comment on that.

If you have no knowledge of the systems in use then this is a real headline grabber however there are lots of factors at play;

-Dryland cropping vs irrigated (well covered by others)


- Cropping as a rotation or double crop, essentially wheat can be grown for a profit bump, or for disease control to prevent continuous cropping to add benefits in soil structure.

- Land use, the US has some land that could easily grow fantastic Wheat to a near record level however its used to grow better cash crops I.e. corn, beans, cotton or veg.

- Variant, saying wheat is wheat is like saying a Apple is and Apple, typically crops are grown for milling or feed, yields can vary on this alone despite any input levels or cost.

- Demand, put simply, the US doesn't domestically need to produce as much wheat so the areas capable of handling and manufacturing are often pockets in some key states resulting in again some of the best lands being turned over to other crops due to logistics.

- Single Farm Payment or EU granting, the Eurpean Union will guarantee prices for wheat in some markets and pay Dutch farmers to produce wheat, meaning they can really push on inputs of herbicides, fungicides and fertiliser safe in the knowledge they will have a market for the crop, the US on a fair trade and competition would limit the inputs often used to meet a price point, sometimes farming more acres for the same yield simply makes more sense.

The same sites also has yields for different crops, in most cases it is similar (so slightly higher or lower, like potatoes, maize, and lettuce), or significantly higher than the yields in the US. From tomatoes and beans, to sugar beet and rapeseed. So for what they farm, the yields are high.

It is just a very small patch of land (of which large parts are recovered from the sea). It is very wet, the soil holds lots of water, and mostly heavy clay. It is worked very intensely with relatively small farms. But want to reiterate how small it is again, the state nearest in size is... Maryland. But very large shares of land are devoted to farming.

x5t4rm,0,"As others have mentioned there is a wide wide variety of soil types and productivity. Eastern Colorado dry land, probably lucky to average 30-50 bu a year on 10 year average. Palouse region of idaho and Washington, a lot of areas average 80-100 dry land. Irrigated southern idaho / California / Oregon areas (as well as others) there are people averaging mid to high 1XX. I personally have seen small fields average over 200 bu acre on soft white. New Zealand has growers that continually hit that with some perfect weather conditions near the coast almost every year.",0,,,3,farming
x5t4rm,0,"True Answer: Because the US government wills it and uses a carrot and stick approach to force farmers into farming (or not farming) whatever the government wants. If farmers were left alone, to their own choices, they would have productive crops of whatever the population needs. The government needs to get out of everyone’s lives, not just farmers’, for similar reasons",0,,,-15,farming

x5t4rm,2,"lmao tell that to every neighbor in my farming county, who’ve ALL been disincentivized from raising cattle, growing the crops they used to, etc.  Tell it also to other farmers who’ve been ordered to destroy animals and crops. The taxes on livestock are up, costs of fertilizer artificially inflated with needless war, farm subsidies are down, and on the list goes. 

But collectivists and statists — Communists with cute little hobby farms — never see this aspect of ACTUAL farming and refuse to see the verifiable truth of it.",0,,,-2,farming

x5t4rm,1,"Some is, some isn’t. I lived there for 3 years and none of the farmers near me used irrigation. It was many root veggies and canola. But those guys weren’t factory/corporate farmers. 

The more commercial places definitely use irrigation for wheat, etc. For a rainy country, there’s more irrigation than you’d expect.",0,,,5,farming
x5t4rm,2,"Only cash crops are irrigated, in the Netherlands making a profit on wheat is generally not possible. So adding the extra expense of fuel for irrigation is not usually done by any farmer here.",0,,,2,farming
