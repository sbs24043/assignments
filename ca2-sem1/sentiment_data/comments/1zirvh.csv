http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14735903.2013.806408#.UxaYOT-0cy7

This might be an unpopular opinion. 

It's not the world market's demand, it's an engineered demand, and often an unwelcome one at that. 

""Reviewing the parameters of yield, pesticide use, germplasm diversity and human resources of the US staple crop agroecosystem demonstrates that lessons provided by past technology-derived disasters, such as the southern corn leaf blight epidemic (National Research Council, Committee on Genetic Vulnerability of Major Crops 1972), still have to be learned. The US (and Canadian) yields are falling behind economically and technologically equivalent agroecosystems matched for latitude, season and crop type; pesticide (both herbicide and insecticide) use is higher in the United States than in comparator W. European countries; the industries of all types that are supplying inputs to the farmer are becoming more concentrated and monopolistic (Fuglie et al. 2012) and these tendencies correlate with stagnation or declines in germplasm diversity (Welsh and Glenna 2006, Howard 2009, Domina and Taylor 2010). Farm number is decreasing and scale is increasing, concentrating and narrowing the farming skills. Annual variations in yield, which not only indicate low resilience of the agroecosytem but also can fuel dramatic price changes in agricultural markets, are more severe in the United States than in W. Europe.""

""The diversity of the germplasm is not increasing under the commercial sector in the United States and under prevailing government innovation incentives created through IP instruments or public subsidies. Critically, it appears that the essential diversity being used by the major seed houses was introduced by now defunct public sector breeding programmes (Mikel 2008); the substitution of commercial innovation incentives has not replaced the genetic innovations built by a former applied public sector service under a different, less restrictive, innovation regime (Mikel 2008, Wolinsky 2010). This is linked to globally declining rates in yield growth. ‘The growth rate in world-average crop yields has been slowing for nearly two decades, to some extent as a result of reduced research and development funding’ (USDA 2012b, p. 18). Innovation through reclaimed IP revenue streams has not compensated for the decrease in public good research funding.""",0,,,-2,science

Why is 1986 a bad initial start date? 

The claims in the paper are mainly about food security, germplasm diversity, and I can clearly see the rational behind the timeline, whereas the blog entry does not justify why 1986 would be a bad initial starting point at all. Besides spuriously making the claim.

Would you care to explain yourself what you find objectionable in the paper? The rebuttals I've seen are fairly weak.",0,,,0,science
1zirvh,5,"GMOPundit is the blog of David Tribe, an applied geneticist who teaches graduate/undergrad courses in food science, food safety, biotechnology and microbiology at the University of Melbourne. I think that citing the blog of a university professor who has conducted research and has relevant experience is quite reasonable.

Since you seem to have decided to not read the cited post, I'll quote the relevant portions...

> Heinemann and colleagues have chosen to drawn conclusions of no beneficial yield impact of GM technology in North America by using a comparison period starting in 1986 which is ten years away from the actual start date. In their paper, they give no clear justification for using this start year, and ignore the relevant start point for GM introduction that occurred a decade into their 1986-2011 comparison period. 

> On the other hand, if they had used the right comparison time period, they might have picked up this interesting observation noted by Chris Preston:

> From Chris's calculations above, if anything there has been an acceleration in yield growth in Canada associated with the introduction of GM technology in 1996 that is not seen in the West Europe rapeseed yields for the same period.

> This last figure requires more attention. We can again see that Western Europe starts with lower yields than the USA; however, it keeps on increasing those yields faster than USA, overtaking it during the 1990s. Again, all this change happened while both USA and Western Europe were not using GM corn. The situation reverses in the 2000s, when the USA overtakes Western Europe, while the USA continuously increased the percentage of GM corn. The last bar in Figure 3 is misleading because it includes a single year (2010) and we know that yields in USA went down in 2011 and 2012, affected by a very large drought (see Figure 4).

Heinemann did NOT address the concerns raised by Tribe and others. ***Tribe didn't skew the data, he pointed out that Heinemann skewed the data and proved that the data doesn't actually support Heinemann's claims.***",0,,,2,science
1zirvh,6,"I love how you need others to speak for you.

Either David Tribe is lying or he needs to re-read what he is criticizing. 

In your own words explain to me why 1986 is an inappropriate year.

The part of the paragraph Tribe conspicuously chose to leave out:

**""Biotechnology choices in the form of breeding stock and/or management techniques used in Europe are as effective at maintaining yield as are germplasm/management combinations in the United States.""**

The criticism he is levelling at Heinemann is in fact addressed in the Heinemann paper, as well as his own critique of the paper, as well as the linked critique of another scientists blog. 

The point of the Maize analysis is that Biotechnology in Europe in recent years with regards to Maize is comparable in yield to the  North American counterpart. 

It follows that they are valid counterpoints to analyze. 

He even says in the quoted paragraph "" the average yields were not significantly different"". 

>Heinemann and colleagues have chosen to drawn conclusions of no beneficial yield impact of GM technology in North America by using a comparison period starting in 1986 which is ten years away from the actual start date.

This is not where they draw such conclusions.

His conclusion from the data Tribe discusses is that ""Although GM maize varieties have been in commercial production for most of the measured period since 1985, the linear regression of maize yield in W. Europe from 1985 to 2010 (y = 1156x + 66699, R² = 0.75) again shows that the slope of increase per year is steeper in W. Europe than the United States (y = 1053.4x + 67302, R² = 0.55).""

Why does he use 1985? Because that's when commercial GM maize has been in production. The first crop field trials begin, and it becomes increasingly entrenched in US agri management, which is the bulk of the paper's discussion.

**What is the conclusion he draws from this data?** Certainly not Tribe's strawman. He even addresses further issues which were raised in Tribe's spurious compilation of critiques...

""Unfortunate weather variations, such as two contiguous years of water stress in the United States, can overwhelm the subtle contributions of a generally good technology; however, the overall variance in yields of the two agroecosystems provides an indication of their inherent resilience to stress. We therefore calculated coefficients of variance (CVs) to measure the year-to-year variability of the agroecosystems. As the mean yields increase in both agroecosystems over the 50-year period from 1961 to 2010, we could not simply calculate CVs from average means and standard deviations. Hence, we instead obtained means and standard deviations of the residuals (a measure of annual variability) of the linear regressions (of the maize yield increase in the United States and W. Europe from 1961 to 2010) to determine CVs. The CV for W. Europe was 0.11, lower than the 0.14 measured for the United States

**In conclusion, we see that the data Tribe cherry-picks is not used to make the claim which he says it does, namely ""no beneficial yield impact of GM tech"", which the author of the original paper calls ""a generally good technology"". What is the claim being made? That there is no beneficial yield increase IN COMPARISON with a reasonably comparable and technologically equivalent region. AKA, Gm is no silver bullet. The start date of 1985-6 is not only reasonable but crucial to the scope of the paper which is dealing with crop-management and agribusiness methods over a 50 year period. Tribe deals with none of the meat of this paper, and has erected a strawman to serve as a defamatory and misleading critique.**",0,,,-4,science
