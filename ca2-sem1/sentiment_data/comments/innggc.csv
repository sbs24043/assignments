GM = higher yields = more food = less starvation. That's the story everyone is sold. Trying to understand the number of lives ""saved"" by GM production is a very difficult number to estimate for several reasons. First, there is no real counter story. Yields increased massively from the 1920s for many many reasons. GM didn't hit the scene until the 90s. Go to FAOstat to look at trends. Also the globalization of grain markets alone and changes to American farm structure changed the global food supply in complicated ways. From my first post, yields are very very high without GM methods and food waste is incredible. Agribusiness LOVES that people generally believe they are saving lives with their work but they're really just focused on cornering markets and contracting farmers with new tech.

I agree there's tons of people against GMO for stupid reasons but it distracts from serious issues with corporate control of food production. I'd be totally fine with GMO foods if they weren't being leveraged to basically give six companies all control over how farms are run.

Most farmers buy new seeds. For hybrid seeds (ie corn) it's pointless to save seeds as subsequent generations will yield poorly (see hybrid vigor). This is has nothing to do with GMOs, it's just how hybrids work (popularized in the 1930s by the way).

Furthermore, farmers want the flexibility to rotate crops and try new varieties. On top of this, crop genetics are always improving, about 2-3% yield increase per year, so it makes sense to have the latest and greatest.

innggc,1,"> but GMOs are bad!

I know you mean this in a sarcastic way, but Norman Borlaug was not involved in GMOs. Technically, a GMO is an organism altered in a way that ""does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination"". It does not include hybrids. Creating a GMO requires genetic engineering and transgenic DNA technology.

Borlaug created his hybrid dwarf wheat in 1953, the same year in which Watson and Crick first discovered the structure of DNA. It took many decades before scientists learned to manipulate DNA in the lab. The first GMO wasn't created until 1973, when Boyer and Cohen modified a bacterium to make it resistant to kanamycin. The first GMO crop was created ten years later in 1983, when a strain of herbicide resistant tobacco was produced by inserting a gene from *agrobacterium* into the plant genome, and the first commercially successful GMO was Bt-tobacco with the insecticide gene from *Bacillus thurigensis*, produced in 1987.

Norman Borlaug's Green Revolution happened long before any of this, and was based on traditional methods of hybridizing plants, which have been used for thousands of years. After Borlaug revolutionized wheat with his Japanese-American dwarf hybrid, the International Rice Research Institute did the same for rice, creating the dwarfed high-yield versions of *indica* and *japonica* rice. They also used traditional hybridization techniques, this was too early for genetic engineering.

I am very much pro-GMO because GMO can improve the hit-and-miss randomness of hybridization, and also because GMO makes possible pairings that could never occur naturally. It's the difference between drug discovery by randomly medicating yourself with fifty plant extracts to see which one will cure your infection, versus tailoring an antibiotic in the lab that is specifically designed for the job. The latter is much faster and more certain of success.

But it's also important to remember that GMO is in its infancy. The vast majority of improvements in agriculture so far have come from traditional hybridization methods, not from GMO. Most of the benefits of GMO are still in the future.",0,,,31,todayilearned

Being ""rich"" is entirely relative.   
Our poorest nations are ""rich"" compared to those that lived thousands of years ago.  
and those were ""rich"" compared to those before them (assuming a general continuity of advancement)   


One thing that you're confusing is that people that have access to family planning and birth control do so largely in accordance to their cultural value systems.  That in Western nations you have career and other pressures taking advantage of birth control.  leading those nations to have low birth rates.  


Where you have such nations and cultures where children birth rates are high (various reasons) largely in an effort to ensure that a few survive into adulthood (numbers game) the introduction of ample food supplies has to be counter balanced with family planning so that with the threat of removal of starvation the society remains stable.

It's simply something that happens after the fact and not before.   


Cultural value systems are very slow to change, people are very willing to take what they want (food, fancy tech & ""toys"" that make their lives easier within their current social and economic systems) but they do not want real change to any of those aforementioned systems.  


So you have to pair food and medicine with something like family planning as part of the deal.  To ""encourage"" change of the value system of large families as a sign of success.   


  
All other thing follow naturally in line if you accomplish that sone simple thing.  The problem with these ""well meaning people"" is that they don't do that.

innggc,5,"I think that you're partially mistaken. Women cannot be emancipated as long as the people are living in a subsistence farming lifestyle. AFAIK, most women don't have the body strength to fairly compete in that kind of place. By providing more automation, body strength becomes less important for job opportunities, and women can compete more in the marketplace.

Also, the data is pretty clear - raise GDP per capita, and birth rates go down. I am unsure of the exact factors, and I suspect no one really knows for sure, but there hasn't been an extreme outlier yet. There is good reason to believe that increasing GDP per capita of poor countries by itself will also lower birth rates in those countries. Having said that, I agree with you that easy access to birth control, normalizing use of birth control, and emancipating women to be more than mothers and housewives aka giving them career opportunities, are all undoubtably important factors.",0,,,1,todayilearned
innggc,6,">Women cannot be emancipated as long as the people are living in a subsistence farming lifestyle.

The introduction of new high yield crops is what this deals with specifically.  
You change the issue with food security, you also change the need for extra hands, high infant mortality and the burden of time.  


Female emancipation is NOT something that needs a bulletpoint, it will happen on it's own with lower rates of child birth as natural change in the society, you need not and should not force it.  In fact forcing it will often become a issue for a cultural backlash as is what happened with Islamic nations like Afghanistan where school girls were killed.   It also is what happened in Iran with the westernization and forcing of western cultural values on a society.  


The net effect is that you have a doubling down on maintaining the cultural values of high birth rates that result in population explosions. IF you look at the figures you'll see exactly what I mean, it takes generations for things to calm down.   


I think your reasoning is putting the cart before the horse so to speak.
