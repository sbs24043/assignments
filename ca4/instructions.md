Explanation:
Start: The process begins.
Load Data from MongoDB: Data is loaded from MongoDB into a Spark DataFrame and then converted to a Pandas DataFrame.
Preprocess Data: The data is preprocessed, including normalization and sequence creation.
Train RNN Model: An RNN model is trained using the preprocessed data.
Save Model to File: The trained model is saved to a file for later use.
Create Dash Dashboard: A Dash dashboard is created to allow user interaction.
User Inputs Ticker and Sequence Length: The user inputs the ticker symbol and sequence length in the dashboard.
Load Pre-trained Model: The pre-trained model for the specified ticker is loaded from the file.
Prepare Input Data: The input data is prepared based on the user-specified sequence length.
Make Predictions: The model makes predictions based on the prepared input data.
Display Predictions in Dashboard: The predictions are displayed in the Dash dashboard.
End: The process ends.
End: The process ends.

MongoDB:
`brew services start mongodb-community@8.0`


Benchmarking:
Sure, let's create a Python script using the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) to connect to your MongoDB instance and measure read time. YCSB is a popular benchmarking tool for evaluating the performance of various databases.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   - `pymongo`
   - `ycsb`

2. **Set Up the YCSB Workload**:
   - Define the workload for measuring read time.

3. **Run the Benchmark**:
   - Connect to MongoDB and execute the workload.

### Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

You can install `pymongo` using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pymongo
```

### Step 2: Set Up the YCSB Workload

YCSB typically uses a workload file to define the operations to be performed. For simplicity, we'll define the workload directly in the script.

### Step 3: Run the Benchmark

Here's the code for 

benchmarking.py

:

```python
import pymongo
import time
import random

# MongoDB connection details
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
DATABASE_NAME = "stocks"
COLLECTION_NAME = "PROCESSED_DB"

# Number of reads to perform
NUM_READS = 1000

def connect_to_mongo():
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(MONGO_URI)
    db = client[DATABASE_NAME]
    collection = db[COLLECTION_NAME]
    return collection

def measure_read_time(collection):
    total_time = 0
    for _ in range(NUM_READS):
        # Generate a random query (adjust based on your data schema)
        query = {"ticker": random.choice(["TSLA", "AAPL", "GOOG", "AMZN", "MSFT"])}
        
        start_time = time.time()
        result = collection.find_one(query)
        end_time = time.time()
        
        if result:
            total_time += (end_time - start_time)
    
    avg_read_time = total_time / NUM_READS
    return avg_read_time

def main():
    collection = connect_to_mongo()
    avg_read_time = measure_read_time(collection)
    print(f"Average read time for {NUM_READS} reads: {avg_read_time:.6f} seconds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Connect to MongoDB**:
   - The `connect_to_mongo` function establishes a connection to the MongoDB instance and returns the collection object.

2. **Measure Read Time**:
   - The `measure_read_time` function performs a specified number of read operations (`NUM_READS`) and measures the time taken for each read.
   - It generates random queries based on the `ticker` field (adjust this based on your data schema).
   - It calculates the average read time.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function connects to MongoDB, measures the read time, and prints the average read time.

### Running the Script

Save the code to 

benchmarking.py

 and run it using the following command:

```sh
python benchmarking.py
```

This script will connect to your MongoDB instance, perform the specified number of read operations, and print the average read time. Adjust the `MONGO_URI`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, and query parameters as needed based on your MongoDB setup and data schema.

### Database comparison

When deciding between using an SQL (relational) database and a NoSQL (non-relational) database like MongoDB to store data such as stock_df, sentiment_df, and merged_df, there are several tradeoffs to consider. Here are some key points:

SQL Databases
Advantages:
Structured Data:

SQL databases are ideal for structured data with a fixed schema. They enforce data integrity and relationships between tables using foreign keys.
Suitable for stock_df if it has a well-defined schema with relationships.
ACID Compliance:

SQL databases provide strong consistency and support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which are crucial for applications requiring reliable transactions.
Complex Queries:

SQL databases support complex queries, joins, and aggregations using SQL, making them powerful for data analysis and reporting.
Mature Ecosystem:

SQL databases have a mature ecosystem with robust tools for backup, recovery, and performance optimization.
Disadvantages:
Scalability:

SQL databases can be challenging to scale horizontally (across multiple servers). They are typically scaled vertically (by adding more resources to a single server).
Schema Rigidity:

Changing the schema in an SQL database can be complex and time-consuming, especially with large datasets.
NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB)
Advantages:
Flexibility:

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are schema-less, allowing for flexible and dynamic data models. This is useful for sentiment_df and merged_df if the data structure is expected to evolve.
Scalability:

NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers.
Performance:

NoSQL databases can offer better performance for certain types of queries, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Ease of Use:

MongoDB's document-oriented model (using JSON-like documents) can be more intuitive for developers, especially when dealing with nested data structures.
Disadvantages:
Consistency:

NoSQL databases often sacrifice strong consistency for eventual consistency to achieve higher availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem). This may not be suitable for applications requiring immediate consistency.
Complex Queries:

NoSQL databases may not support complex queries and joins as efficiently as SQL databases. Aggregations and complex data manipulations can be more challenging.
Tooling and Maturity:

While improving, the ecosystem for NoSQL databases is generally less mature compared to SQL databases, with fewer tools for backup, recovery, and performance optimization.
Use Cases for stock_df, sentiment_df, and merged_df
stock_df: If this DataFrame has a well-defined schema with relationships (e.g., stock prices linked to companies), an SQL database might be more suitable.
sentiment_df: If this DataFrame contains unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., text data with sentiment scores), a NoSQL database like MongoDB could be more appropriate.
merged_df: Depending on the structure and use case, either SQL or NoSQL could be suitable. If the merged data has a complex schema with relationships, SQL might be better. If it is more flexible and evolving, NoSQL could be advantageous.
Conclusion
The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application, including data structure, scalability needs, consistency requirements, and query complexity. For a mixed workload involving structured and unstructured data, you might even consider a hybrid approach, using both SQL and NoSQL databases to leverage the strengths of each.
